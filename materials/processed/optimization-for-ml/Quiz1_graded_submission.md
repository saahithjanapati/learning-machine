**1 Questions: For True/False questions, justify answer!**

1. Given a set $C$, what is the definition of its convex hull?
> [Handwritten]: the minimal convex set that contains all points in $C$

2. True or False? The $L_p$ balls are convex for all $p > 0$.
> [Handwritten]: False. It's $p \ge 1$.

3. True or False? The operator norm satisfies the triangle inequality.
> [Handwritten]: True, norm induces metric space

4. True or False? If $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A^T A$, $x$ is the corresponding eigenvector, and $Ax \neq 0$, then $\lambda$ is also an eigenvalue of $AA^T$.
> [Handwritten]: $(A^T A - \lambda I)x = 0 \implies A^T Ax = \lambda Ix \implies Ax = A \lambda I x \implies Ix = AA^T \lambda I x$
> $\frac{1}{\lambda} Ix = AA^T x \implies AA^T x - \frac{1}{\lambda} Ix = 0$
> True (circled)

5. What is the definition of the normal cone?
> [Handwritten]: $g_c(x) = \{ \nabla f(y-x) \le 0 \mid y \in \text{Dom}(f) \}$

6. What is the 1st-order characterization of convexity?
> [Handwritten]: function is convex if $f(\theta x + (1-\theta)y) \le \theta f(x) + (1-\theta)f(y)$

7. Create a function $f$, that is strictly convex, but $\nabla^2 f(x) \neq 0$ for some $x \in \text{dom}(f)$.
> [Handwritten]: Consider $f(x) = x^4$, $\nabla^2 f(x) = 8x \neq 0$ for $x = -2$

8. True or False? If $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is convex, $g : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is convex, then their composition, $f(g(x))$, is also convex.
> [Handwritten]: False. convex + non-dec. or convex + affine

9. Select all that apply. Briefly justify.
Which of the following are convex:
(a) A countable union of convex sets
(b) An uncountable union of convex sets
(c) A countable intersection of convex sets
(d) An uncountable intersection of convex sets
> [Handwritten]: (c) and (d) are circled. Intersections of convex sets are convex, but not necessarily their union (e.g. union of two circles that touch each other at one point)

### Visual Description
Scanned page of the test with handwritten answers. There are some scratchpad calculations in the left margin for question 7 ($x^4, 4x^3, 8x$). In question 9, options (c) and (d) are circled.

10. Select all that apply. Briefly justify.
Consider a function $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$. Which of the following statements are true?
(a) If $f$ is convex, then it must be differentiable everywhere.
(b) If $f$ is convex and differentiable, then $f(y) \ge f(x) + \langle \nabla f(x), y - x \rangle$ for all $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^n$.
(c) If $f$ is strictly convex, then any local minimum is also a global minimum.
(d) If $f$ is convex, then the sublevel sets $\{x : f(x) \le \alpha\}$ are convex for all $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$.
> [Handwritten]: (b), (c), and (d) are circled.
> Next to (a): -false ($|x|=f(x)$)
> Next to (c): there is only one local minimum which is global...

11. Using the definition and properties of convexity, prove Bernoulli's inequality: for $t \ge 0, r \ge 1$, we have $(1+t)^r \ge 1 + rt$.
Hint: remember the definition of convexity where the tangent line approximation is a global under-estimator of the function.
> [Handwritten]: note, $\nabla f = r(1+t)^{r-1}$.

### Visual Description
Scanned page of the test. Question 10 has options (b), (c), and (d) circled with handwritten justifications on the side. Question 11 has a single line of handwritten text.

12. Let $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ be convex, differentiable. Let $C$ be convex. Consider the optimization problem $\min_{x \in C} f(x)$. State the theorem that characterizes the optimal solutions of this optimization problem in terms of the gradient of $f$ and the normal cone in the points of $C$.
> [Handwritten]: $y \in \min_{x \in C} f(x) \iff \nabla f(y-x) \le 0$

13. Let $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ be convex. What does it mean that its subgradients are monotone?
