- 1 pt Click here to replace this description.

1.3 (no title) 0 / 1 pt
- 0 pts Correct: $\partial f(x) = \text{conv}\left( \bigcup_{i:f_i(x)=f(x)} \partial f_i(x) \right)$, i.e. the convex hull of union of subdifferentials of all active functions at $x$
- 0.5 pts Union needs to be restricted to active functions, i.e. only those $i$ where $f_i(x) = f(x)$
- 0.5 pts Other (single) error in definition
- 1 pt Incorrect

1.4 (no title) 0 / 1 pt
- 0 pts Correct: $\min_{i=0,\dots,k} \|\nabla f(x^{(i)})\|_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2\beta}{k}(f(x^0) - f(x^*))} = O\left(\frac{\sqrt{\beta}}{\sqrt{k}}\right)$
- 0.1 pts Wrong iterate (need minimum of i = 0, .... k) but otherwise correct
- 0.5 pts Incorrect or missing RHS (rate)
- 0.5 pts Incorrect or missing LHS (quantity)
- 1 pt Incorrect

1.5 (no title) 0.99 / 1 pt
- 0 pts Correct
- 0.5 pts did not have $f(x_k) - f(x^*)$, either in words or equation
- 0.5 pts did not relate to $O\left(\frac{\beta}{k}\right)$, $\beta$ here is required in the big-O since we don't actually treat it as a constant when generalizing the bound. (1/k is okay when thinking about it but we are looking for a precise, big-O answer here in terms of $\beta$ and k)
- 1 pt wrong
- 0.01 pts $-\epsilon$
1 write big-O

### Visual Description

1 Questions
1. Write down the main steps for the 'projected subgradient method' algorithm.
(Handwritten answer:)
1. $y_{t+1} = x_t - g_t \eta$
2. $x_{t+1} = \Pi_C(y_{t+1})$ where $\Pi_C(y_{t+1}) = \text{argmin}_{v \in C} \|v - y_{t+1}\|^2$

2. If a convex function $f$ is Lipschitz with parameter $G$, what can we say about its subgradients?
(Handwritten answer:)
$\|\nabla f(y) - \nabla f(x)\| \le G \|y - x\|$ (crossed out)
$f(y) \le f(x) + g^T(y-x)$
$\|g\|^2 \le G$ (boxed)

3. Let $f_1, f_2, f_3$ be three convex functions defined on the same domain. What is the subgradient of $f(x) = \max(f_1(x), f_2(x), f_3(x))$?
(Handwritten answer:)
$\partial(x) = \partial_i(x)$ where $\partial_i$ is subgradient for the $f_i$ that is min @ $x$.

4. What convergence rate does Gradient Descent achieve when minimizing $\beta$-smooth, possibly non-convex functions with step-size $\eta = 1/\beta$? (State the answer as a function of $\beta, k$ without justification. Be precise about the quantity that is converging — the rate alone is not sufficient)
(Handwritten answer:)
$k = \frac{\beta}{\alpha}$ (crossed out)
$\beta/k$

5. What is the best converge rate that Gradient Descent can achieve when minimizing $\beta$-smooth convex functions with a fixed step-size $\eta = 1/\beta$? (State the answer as a function of $\beta, k$ without justification. Be precise about the quantity that is converging — the rate alone is not sufficient)
(Handwritten answer:)
$\beta/k$
$\|x^* - x_k\|$

6. True or False: For functions that are $\alpha$ strongly convex, we are guaranteed a linear convergence rate for gradient descent. Justify briefly.
(Handwritten answer:)
False, we need strongly convex + L smooth for linear convergence.

7. Prove or disprove that the negative gradient $-\nabla f(x)$ is a descent direction for any differentiable $f$.
(Handwritten answer:)
False. Consider $f(x)=1$, descent $-\nabla f(x)=0$, which does not descend.

8. Consider applying one step of the subgradient method to a convex function.
True or False: If one is not at the global optimum, then for any choice of subgradient, there exists a positive stepsize such that the next iterate strictly decreases the function value. (No need to justify.)
(Handwritten answer:)
False

9. Consider the convex function $F : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $F(\theta_1, \theta_2) = |\theta_1| + 2|\theta_2|$. Write down any subgradient of $F$ at $(1, 0)$. No justification needed.
(Handwritten answer:)
$\langle 1, 0 \rangle$

10. Select all that apply. For a convex function $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ that is differentiable at point $x$, the subdifferential $\partial f(x)$ is:
A) The empty set
B) The singleton set $\{\nabla f(x)\}$
C) All vectors with norm less than $\|\nabla f(x)\|$
D) The normal cone at $x$
No justification needed.
(Handwritten answer:)
B

11. Select all that apply. Let $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ be twice differentiable. Which conditions are sufficient for $f$ to be convex? No justification needed.
A) $\nabla^2 f(x) \succ 0$ (positive definite) for all $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$.
B) $\nabla^2 f(x) \succeq 0$ (positive semidefinite) for all $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$.
C) $f(y) - f(x) - \langle \nabla f(x), y - x \rangle \ge 0$ for all $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^n$.
D) $f(\theta x + (1 - \theta)y) \le \theta f(x) + (1 - \theta)f(y)$ for all $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\theta \in [0, 1]$.
(Handwritten answer:)
A, D
(Handwritten note on side:) $f(y) - f(x) \ge \langle \nabla f(x), y-x \rangle$

12. True or False. Let $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ be a convex function. Then the epigraph $\text{epi}(f) := \{(x, t) \in \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R} : f(x) \le t\}$ is a convex set. No need to justify your answer.
(Handwritten answer:)
True
(Handwritten note below:) $\{(x, t) \in \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R} : f(x) \le t\}$
