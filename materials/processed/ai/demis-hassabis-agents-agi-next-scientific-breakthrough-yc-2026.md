## Summary

In this Y Combinator interview, Demis Hassabis discusses what is still missing before AGI, why memory and continual learning matter, how reinforcement learning and search from AlphaGo still shape modern foundation-model work, why smaller distilled models are becoming strategically important, and why agents are only just getting started.

The second half turns toward science and startups. Hassabis explains why AlphaFold is the prototype for AI-for-science breakthroughs, what would make a domain ripe for an AlphaFold-style result, how virtual cells might be built, and why founders should combine AI with deep technical domains rather than merely wrap a foundation-model API.

The practical thesis is that AGI may arrive in the middle of today's deep-tech startup journeys. Founders should therefore build things that remain valuable when much stronger general systems exist: physical systems, scientific infrastructure, specialized tools, high-quality data, and hard interdisciplinary capabilities that future general agents can use.

## Transcript Digest

### 00:00-01:48 - Introduction And Career Path

The interview opens with Hassabis naming several unresolved AGI ingredients: continual learning, long-term reasoning, memory, and consistency. He also frames agents as the active systems required for AGI.

Garry Tan introduces Hassabis' career as an unusual arc: chess prodigy, teenage game designer, cognitive neuroscience PhD, DeepMind co-founder, AlphaGo, AlphaFold, Nobel-winning chemistry work, and Google DeepMind's Gemini effort.

The opening frame is not just biography. It positions Hassabis as someone who has pursued a single long project: understanding and building general intelligence.

### 01:48-03:36 - What's Missing Before AGI

Hassabis says the current ingredients in frontier AI, including large-scale pretraining, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and chain-of-thought style reasoning, are likely part of the final AGI architecture. He does not think the field will discover that the current path is a total dead end.

But he thinks one or two big ideas may still be missing. He names continual learning, long-term reasoning, aspects of memory, and across-the-board consistency. Existing techniques may scale into these abilities with incremental innovation, or there may still be one or two major conceptual pieces left.

His rough view is that this is a 50/50 question: either the known paradigm plus refinement is enough, or a small number of missing ideas remain.

### 03:36-06:14 - Why Memory Is Still Unsolved

Hassabis connects AI memory to his neuroscience work on the hippocampus, episodic memory, and consolidation. Biological brains integrate new knowledge gracefully into an existing knowledge base, especially during sleep and replay.

DeepMind's early DQN system for Atari already borrowed a version of this idea through experience replay, where successful trajectories were replayed during learning.

He says current AI memory often feels like duct tape: shove more into the context window. A million-token context window can be useful, but it is still a brute-force working memory, not a principled memory system. The real problem is retrieving the right information at the right moment, ignoring irrelevant or wrong information, and managing long-term experience.

He also notes that live video or life-logging can consume huge numbers of tokens quickly. If a system is meant to understand a user's life over weeks or months, context length alone is not enough.

### 06:14-08:06 - AlphaGo, RL, Search, And Gemini

Hassabis says DeepMind has worked on agents since the beginning. The early Atari work, AlphaGo, AlphaZero, MuZero, and AlphaStar were all agent systems: systems that act, plan, make decisions, and pursue goals.

The big question has been whether those game-domain ideas can generalize into world models and language models. He sees today's thinking modes and chain-of-thought reasoning as descendants of some ideas pioneered in AlphaGo.

He expects old ideas from AlphaGo and AlphaZero, including search and Monte Carlo tree search, to become newly relevant when applied at foundation-model scale.

### 08:06-12:40 - Smaller Models, Distillation, And Fast Workflows

Hassabis says Google DeepMind's strength is not only building frontier models but also distilling capability into smaller models quickly. This matters because Google must serve enormous surfaces: Search, AI Overviews, AI Mode, the Gemini app, Maps, YouTube, Android, and many other products.

That scale creates pressure to make models fast, cheap, low-latency, and efficient. He points to Flash and smaller models as examples, and says there may not yet be a known theoretical limit on how much capability can be packed into smaller models.

For builders, smaller models matter in two ways. First, they reduce cost. Second, their speed can compensate for a slight capability gap by enabling faster iteration. A model that is 90-95% as capable but much faster may be better for interactive workflows.

He also emphasizes edge models for privacy, security, robotics, and personal devices. A future system may process sensitive audio-visual streams locally, while delegating only selected tasks to larger cloud models.

### 12:40-13:32 - Continual Learning And Agents

Hassabis says the lack of continual learning holds agents back from doing full, fire-and-forget tasks. Current agents can do useful subtasks and can be patched together into impressive demos, but they do not adapt well to the specific context they are placed in.

To become fully general, agents need to learn about the environment, the user, the task history, and the specific domain while operating.

### 13:32-15:33 - Reasoning Gaps And Jagged Intelligence

Hassabis says there is still a lot of innovation left in thinking paradigms. Current systems can overthink, loop, or pursue bad reasoning paths.

He uses chess as a diagnostic environment. When he plays against Gemini, he can inspect the thinking trace and see when it considers a move, realizes it is a blunder, fails to find a better option, and then returns to the blunder anyway. A precise reasoning system should not behave that way.

This connects to jagged intelligence. The same models can solve extremely hard benchmark problems while still making elementary reasoning mistakes when questions are posed in certain ways. Hassabis suspects some kind of introspection over the model's own thought process is missing or underdeveloped.

### 15:33-18:31 - Agents Are Early, Not Over

Hassabis agrees that agents are just getting started. AGI requires active systems that can solve problems, make plans, and act.

At the same time, he says the field is still in an experimentation phase. People are launching many agents and running long jobs, but the output does not always justify the input yet. The technology is only recently becoming good enough to add serious value rather than produce toy demonstrations.

He expects the first signal of true value to be humans using agents to build best-selling apps, games, or businesses at much higher leverage. Full autonomy will come later. For now, taste, craft, and human direction still matter.

### 18:31-20:26 - Creativity, Move 37, And Inventing Go

Hassabis uses AlphaGo's famous Move 37 as an example of machine surprise. The move was creative in the sense that it challenged human assumptions inside an existing game.

But he sets a harder creativity target: not just finding Move 37, but inventing Go itself. If given a high-level description such as "a game whose rules are learnable in minutes, aesthetically beautiful, playable in an afternoon, and impossible to master in many lifetimes," could an AI invent Go?

He thinks current systems probably cannot do that yet, though it is possible that the right human-AI workflow could get closer than expected. The distinction is between surprising within a known structure and creating the structure itself.

### 20:26-22:26 - Open Models, Gemma, And Local AI

Hassabis says DeepMind supports open science and open source broadly, pointing to AlphaFold as an example of putting a major scientific tool out for free.

For open models, he emphasizes Gemma. DeepMind wants strong open models at specific sizes and sees strategic value in open small models, especially for edge use cases such as Android, glasses, robotics, and local devices.

He also notes the competitive context: many Chinese open models are excellent, and DeepMind wants strong Western open-model stacks as well. Because edge models are vulnerable once deployed widely, making them truly open can be strategically coherent.

### 22:26-24:08 - Why Gemini Was Built Multimodal

Hassabis says Gemini was built multimodal from the start, even though that made early development harder than focusing only on text.

He expects this to pay off for world models, robotics, Waymo, embodied assistants, glasses, and devices that need to understand the user's physical context. A model acting in the real world needs visual, audio, and physical understanding, not only text.

He presents multimodality as a long-run advantage for systems that must model intuitive physics, surroundings, and real-world interactions.

### 24:08-25:24 - Inference Demand And Jevons Paradox

Asked what happens when inference becomes nearly free, Hassabis is skeptical that demand will ever feel free in practice. Jevons paradox may apply: as inference becomes cheaper, people will use more of it.

He imagines millions of agents, swarms of agents, longer thinking, multiple reasoning branches, and ensembles. Even if energy becomes cheap through future breakthroughs, physical bottlenecks such as chip production may still constrain inference.

The lesson is that efficiency will continue to matter. More capability will create more appetite for inference, not necessarily less scarcity.

### 25:24-28:24 - AlphaFold, Isomorphic Labs, And Virtual Cells

Hassabis says Isomorphic Labs is extending beyond AlphaFold into adjacent chemistry and biochemistry for drug discovery. AlphaFold gives protein structure, but drug discovery also requires designing compounds with the right binding behavior and avoiding toxic off-target effects.

The long-term goal is a virtual cell: a working simulation of a cell that can be perturbed and whose outputs are close enough to experiment to be useful. He estimates a full virtual cell may be around ten years away.

The path begins with narrower self-contained systems, such as a virtual nucleus. The challenge is choosing a slice of biological complexity that can be modeled with enough detail while approximating inputs and outputs from the surrounding system.

He also names a data bottleneck. If scientists could image live cells at very high resolution without destroying them, the problem could partly become a vision problem. Without that data, progress may depend more on learned simulators and modeling.

### 28:24-30:43 - AI As The Ultimate Tool For Science

Hassabis says AI as the ultimate tool for science has been his main motivation for working on AI for decades.

DeepMind's mission was often phrased as: solve intelligence, then use it to solve everything else. He clarifies that "everything else" meant root-node problems in science: breakthroughs that unlock whole new branches of discovery.

AlphaFold is the prototype. It is used by millions of researchers, and Hassabis says he has heard that almost every future drug discovery process will use AlphaFold somewhere. He expects similar AlphaFold-one moments in materials, mathematics, drug discovery, climate, and other scientific domains.

### 30:43-33:30 - Founder Advice

For founders, Hassabis recommends looking for the intersection of AI progress and another hard technical field. Deep tech involving the world of atoms may be more defensible than thin wrappers around foundation-model APIs.

The reason is that hard interdisciplinary work is less likely to be erased by the next model update. A strong team that combines machine learning expertise with domain expertise in medicine, materials, robotics, biology, energy, or another difficult area can build durable value.

He also stresses conviction. When DeepMind began, many investors and academics believed AGI was not going to work. If founders are working on something truly early, skepticism is normal. That is why the work needs to be something they genuinely care about.

### 33:30-35:20 - The AlphaFold Breakthrough Pattern

Hassabis describes the pattern behind AlphaGo and AlphaFold-style breakthroughs.

The domain should have a massive combinatorial search space, far too large for brute force or special-case algorithms. It should also have a clear objective function that allows the system to climb toward better solutions. Finally, it needs enough data or a simulator that can generate in-distribution synthetic data.

Go and protein folding both fit this pattern. Drug discovery may also fit it: somewhere in the search space there may be a compound that solves a disease with acceptable side effects, if the system can search efficiently enough.

### 35:20-37:59 - Scientific Discovery And The Einstein Test

Hassabis says AI systems are close to scientific reasoning, but he has not yet seen a true massive scientific discovery from these systems.

Solving a known hard problem, such as a Millennium Prize problem, would be extraordinary. But he sets an even harder target: can AI generate a new set of questions as deep as the Millennium Prize problems themselves?

He proposes an "Einstein test": train a system with a knowledge cutoff around 1901 and see whether it can invent the ideas Einstein produced in 1905, such as special relativity. Passing that kind of test would suggest AI is near genuine novelty rather than only pattern matching or extrapolation.

### 37:59-40:57 - What To Build Before AGI Arrives

Asked what he wishes he knew at 25, Hassabis says hard problems are not necessarily harder than shallow ones; they are differently hard. Because life is short, he recommends putting effort into problems that would matter if solved.

He expects interdisciplinary work to become even more important, especially as AI helps connect fields.

He also gives a practical AGI-timeline warning. If a deep-tech startup usually takes ten years and AGI may arrive around 2030, then founders starting now must plan for AGI arriving mid-journey. They should ask what their system becomes when general models can use specialized tools, what factories or physical systems should exist, and what remains useful in that future.

Hassabis suggests that future general models may use specialized systems like AlphaFold as tools rather than absorbing all specialized knowledge into one giant model. That points toward a world of general-purpose agents orchestrating high-quality specialized tools.

## Key Ideas To Remember

1. Hassabis thinks current AI methods are part of AGI, but continual learning, memory, long-term reasoning, and consistency remain unresolved.
2. Context windows are useful but are not a complete memory system; retrieval, consolidation, and relevance are the deeper problems.
3. AlphaGo, AlphaZero, MuZero, and AlphaStar were early agent systems, and their ideas are returning at foundation-model scale.
4. Smaller distilled models matter because speed, cost, latency, privacy, and edge deployment change what builders can do.
5. Agents are not overhyped in principle, but real production value is still emerging.
6. Current reasoning is jagged: models can solve hard problems while failing simple ones in certain framings.
7. True creativity may require inventing new structures, not only finding surprising moves inside known structures.
8. Gemma and other open models matter for local, edge, and Western open-model ecosystems.
9. Gemini's multimodality is important for robotics, Waymo, world models, and assistants that understand physical context.
10. Virtual cells require both better data and learned simulators.
11. AlphaFold-style breakthroughs need massive search spaces, clear objectives, and enough data or simulation.
12. Founders should build deep, interdisciplinary systems that remain useful if AGI arrives mid-journey.

## Follow-Up Questions

- What would a real memory system for agents look like beyond long context?
- How can AlphaGo-style search and planning be integrated into foundation models without exploding inference cost?
- Which startup domains have AlphaFold-like structure: massive search, clear objective, and enough data or simulation?
- What should a founder build if AGI may arrive before their deep-tech company fully matures?
- How should open small models and private edge models change product architecture?
- What would count as a credible "Einstein test" for scientific discovery?
- When should general agents use specialized tools instead of trying to internalize every capability?

## One-Sentence Takeaway

Hassabis argues that AGI still needs better memory, reasoning, and continual learning, but founders should already plan for a world where general agents orchestrate specialized scientific tools, local models, and deep-tech systems.
