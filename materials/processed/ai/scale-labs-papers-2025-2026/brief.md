## Executive Take

The highest-level pattern in Scale's 2025-2026 research is not "one model breakthrough." It is building the infrastructure for reliable, useful, enterprise-facing agents:

1. Better evaluation of real agent behavior.
2. Better reward signals for open-ended post-training.
3. Better verification and monitoring for long-horizon agents.
4. Better grounding in economically meaningful or professionally meaningful tasks.

Publication mix supports that reading:
- `Safety`: 33 papers
- `Evaluation and Alignment`: 33 papers
- `Reasoning`: 17 papers
- `Agents`: 9 papers
- `Post-Training`: 7 papers
- `Oversight`: 4 papers

So the center of gravity is not just "train better models." It is "build agents that can be evaluated, improved, and trusted in real workflows."

## What Scale Seems To Be Working On

### 1. Agent evaluation that looks more like real work

Representative papers:
- `VeRO`
- `MCP-Atlas`
- `ResearchRubrics`
- `Remote Labor Index`
- `SWE-Bench Pro`
- `ToolComp`
- `MultiChallenge`
- `Professional Reasoning Benchmark`

Interpretation:
- Scale is pushing away from toy benchmarks and toward evaluation harnesses with real tools, longer horizons, messier ambiguity, and clearer workflow-level failure analysis.
- The important unit of analysis is often no longer just "did the model answer correctly?" but "can the agent complete a workflow, use tools appropriately, recover from errors, and justify the result?"

Why this matters for enterprise:
- Enterprise customers care about end-to-end workflow success, not leaderboard scores on narrow static tasks.
- These papers suggest Scale is trying to measure what actually breaks in production: tool selection, ambiguity, context gathering, verification, and recovery.

### 2. RL/post-training beyond exact verifiers

Representative papers:
- `Rubrics as Rewards`
- `Online Rubrics Elicitation from Pairwise Comparisons`
- `Chasing the Tail`
- `Adaptive Guidance Accelerates Reinforcement Learning of Reasoning Models`
- `Agent-RLVR`
- `REASONING GYM`
- `Agentic Rubrics as Contextual Verifiers for SWE Agents`

Interpretation:
- Scale is very clearly interested in RLVR, but not only in the standard math/code setting.
- A major theme is: how do you get dense, interpretable, non-gameable reward signals when the task is open-ended, partially subjective, or long-horizon?

Key idea:
- Rubrics are becoming a bridge between human judgment and machine-trainable reward signals.
- Guidance, contextual verifiers, and procedural environments are all ways of making sparse or brittle reward signals more usable.

This is probably the single strongest connection to your existing idea about extending RL to longer-horizon or non-verifiable tasks.

### 3. Software-engineering agents as a serious research axis

Representative papers:
- `Agent-RLVR`
- `SWE-Bench Pro`
- `Agentic Rubrics as Contextual Verifiers for SWE Agents`
- `VeRO`
- `ProjectTest`

Interpretation:
- SWE agents are not a side project. They are one of the clearest places where Scale is studying long-horizon agents, contextual verification, optimizer loops, and environment-grounded rewards.
- This area is attractive because it sits at the intersection of agents, RL, evaluation, and enterprise value.

Why it matters:
- SWE gives relatively strong feedback signals compared with many other domains.
- But Scale's SWE work is already moving beyond simple unit-test pass/fail into contextual verification, harder enterprise-like tasks, and agent-optimizing-agent loops.

### 4. Safety, oversight, and guardrails for capable agents

Representative papers:
- `Defensive Refusal Bias`
- `Reliable Weak-to-Strong Monitoring of LLM Agents`
- `WebGuard`
- `Chain of Thought Monitorability`
- `Teaching Models to Verbalize Reward Hacking`
- `A Red Teaming Roadmap Towards System-Level Safety`
- `FORTRESS`
- `J2`
- `PropensityBench`
- `Best Practices for Biorisk Evaluations`

Interpretation:
- Scale's safety work is not just abstract alignment language. It is largely operational: how to evaluate risk, monitor trajectories, detect bad behavior, red team systems, and keep agents useful without making them unusably restrictive.

Best framing for your own safety interest:
- Do not present it as "I want to do abstract alignment theory."
- Present it as "I care about making capable agentic systems reliable, monitorable, and aligned with intended task behavior, especially in real enterprise settings."

That framing matches Scale's paper mix much better.

### 5. Benchmarks that are harder, broader, and more economically grounded

Representative papers:
- `Humanity's Last Exam`
- `ENIGMAEVAL`
- `MoReBench`
- `TutorBench`
- `MultiNRC`
- `Audio MultiChallenge`
- `Remote Labor Index`
- `Progress over Points`

Interpretation:
- Scale is not only producing benchmarks; it is actively redefining what "good evaluation" should look like.
- A recurring theme is dissatisfaction with static, saturated, or academically narrow test sets.
- The stronger papers try to tie evaluation to real professional work, long-horizon behavior, or scientific progress itself.

## Fit With Your Interests

Your updated interest stack is coherent:

1. Agents
2. Fine-tuning / RL / RLVR
3. Evaluation and rubrics
4. Safety / oversight
5. Software-engineering agents
6. Dataset design and data quality


That is actually a strong fit to the observed Scale research surface.

The cleanest way to describe your interests is:

> I am most interested in agentic systems, especially where post-training, verification, and evaluation all interact: long-horizon agents, contextual or rubric-based reward signals, software-engineering agents, and safety/monitoring for real-world deployments.

That sounds much tighter than listing "agents, finetuning, rubrics, safety" as separate buckets.

## Which Of Your Ideas Fit Best

### Strong fit

- Extending RL beyond strictly verifiable domains.
  - This maps directly onto `Rubrics as Rewards`, `Chasing the Tail`, `Online Rubrics Elicitation`, and `Agentic Rubrics`.

- RL for long-horizon tasks.
  - This maps to `Agent-RLVR`, `LHAW`, `VeRO`, `SWE-Bench Pro`, and `ResearchRubrics`.

- Coding agents or coding-agent harnesses for non-coding tasks.
  - This is surprisingly strong, not weird.
  - Anthropic explicitly said in September 2025 that the harness behind Claude Code had become useful for deep research, video creation, note-taking, and other non-coding applications, and that the same harness could power many other types of agents.
  - That means your intuition already lines up with a real industry direction.

- Improving software-engineering agents.
  - This is a very safe and credible direction to mention because Scale already has visible depth here.

- Safety as reliability and oversight.
  - Strong fit if you frame it concretely around monitoring, guardrails, verification, and agent failure analysis.

### Medium fit, but frame carefully

- RL for creative writing or art.
  - Interesting, but less directly connected to Scale's visible 2025-2026 work.
  - If you mention it, frame it as a broader example of the same core research problem: open-ended tasks with weak or non-binary reward signals.

- Personalized tutoring agents with memory.
  - There is some fit because of `TutorBench`, but tutoring itself does not look like the center of Scale's applied agenda.
  - Better framing: personalized expert assistants or domain agents with memory, context management, and rubric-based evaluation.

## Best Project Angles To Mention

If you want to sound sharp and aligned, these are better than broad generic statements:

### 1. Contextual verifiers for non-coding agents

Question:
- Can ideas like `Agentic Rubrics` transfer from SWE agents to deep-research, support, ops, or analyst-style agents?

Why it is strong:
- Connects agents, rubrics, RL, and evaluation.
- Fits your "coding agents for non-coding tasks" idea.
- Feels very Scale-like because it is grounded in enterprise workflows.

### 2. RL beyond exact verifiers for long-horizon enterprise tasks

Question:
- How do you train agents when the task has many valid outputs, partial observability, and delayed outcomes?

Concrete angle:
- Combine rubric rewards, contextual verification, and trajectory-level signals.

Why it is strong:
- This is basically the shared frontier behind `Rubrics as Rewards`, `Chasing the Tail`, `ResearchRubrics`, and `Agent-RLVR`.

### 3. Agent transfer from coding to non-coding domains

Question:
- Which parts of a coding-agent harness actually transfer: tool interface, memory, plan/act/verify loop, trace structure, or verifier design?

Why it is strong:
- It is original enough to sound like your own idea, but still clearly connected to recent industry movement.

### 4. Better verification and test-time scaling for SWE agents

Question:
- Can contextual verifiers, patch-level rubric scoring, or optimizer-agent loops improve software agents more efficiently than just running more tests?

Why it is strong:
- It is squarely within Scale's visible research lane and easy for a mentor to map to concrete projects.

### 5. Monitoring and safety for long-horizon agents

Question:
- How do you detect risky or misaligned behavior in agents that use tools, maintain state, and act over long horizons?

Why it is strong:
- It lets you mention safety without drifting into vague theory.
- It connects to `Weak-to-Strong Monitoring`, `WebGuard`, `Defensive Refusal Bias`, and `Red Teaming Roadmap`.

## How To Talk About The "Coding Agents For Non-Coding Tasks" Idea

This is the cleanest wording:

> One direction I am interested in is whether the harnesses that make coding agents effective - tool use, explicit planning, memory, file/system interaction, and iterative verify-and-revise loops - can transfer to non-coding enterprise tasks like deep research, support, operations, or analyst workflows. I am especially interested in how to evaluate and train those agents once the task is no longer cleanly verifiable.

Why this wording works:
- It sounds like a research question, not a vague product instinct.
- It connects directly to agents, evaluation, and RL.
- It is broad enough to be useful to a mentor choosing a project, but specific enough to sound thoughtful.

## How To Talk About Safety

A good, honest version:

> I am also broadly interested in safety, especially in the practical sense of making sure capable models and agents do what we intend in real settings: monitoring, guardrails, reliable evaluation, and understanding failure modes in long-horizon workflows.

This avoids pretending you are already a safety specialist while still signaling real interest.

## Suggested Ranking To Send

If you want a ranked version that reads clearly:

1. Agents, especially long-horizon and enterprise-facing agents
2. Post-training / fine-tuning, especially RL and RLVR
3. Evaluation, rubrics, and verification
4. Software-engineering agents
5. Safety / oversight / monitoring
6. Dataset design and data quality

I would move software-engineering agents above dataset design/data quality because it is both a genuine interest of yours and much more visibly central in the current Scale papers.

## Suggested Response Draft

You should customize the start date, but this is a strong draft:

Hi [Mentor Name],

Thanks, my start date is [START DATE].

In terms of areas I am most interested in, I would roughly rank them as:

1. agents, especially long-horizon / enterprise-facing agents
2. post-training / fine-tuning, especially RL and RLVR
3. evaluation, rubrics, and verification
4. software-engineering agents
5. safety / oversight / monitoring
6. dataset design and data quality

One direction I have been thinking about is how to extend RL-style post-training beyond strictly verifiable domains. I am very interested in settings where the task is long-horizon or open-ended, so exact correctness is hard to define and you need better reward signals, contextual verifiers, or rubric-based evaluation.

Related to that, I am also interested in whether the harnesses that make coding agents effective can transfer to non-coding enterprise tasks. In my own exploration, I have found that coding-agent style systems can already work surprisingly well for things like tutoring or research assistance when they have tools, memory, and an explicit plan/act/verify loop. I would be excited about projects on how to adapt those kinds of agents to broader domains, and especially how to evaluate or train them once the task is no longer cleanly verifiable.

I am also very interested in software-engineering agents directly, especially around better verification, longer-horizon task settings, and agent-improving-agent loops.

More broadly, I care about safety in the practical sense of making sure capable agents do what we intend in real settings: monitoring, guardrails, and understanding failure modes in long-horizon workflows.

Looking through Scale's recent research, what stood out to me is the focus on grounded, application-facing problems: real agent benchmarks and evaluation harnesses (`MCP-Atlas`, `SWE-Bench Pro`, `ResearchRubrics`, `Remote Labor Index`) together with post-training methods that make RL and verification work in more realistic settings (`Rubrics as Rewards`, `Agent-RLVR`, `Agentic Rubrics`, `VeRO`). That overall direction feels like a very strong fit for what I would like to work on.

Happy to share more ideas if useful, but those are the main directions I am most excited about right now.

Best,
Saahith

## Trend Snapshot Beyond Scale

As of March 30, 2026, the broader field is moving in a direction that reinforces your pitch:

- Anthropic argued that strong agent systems tend to use simple, composable patterns rather than overly complex frameworks, and that agents are best suited to open-ended problems where the number of steps cannot be hardcoded and where they can gather ground truth from the environment at each step.
- Anthropic also explicitly said in September 2025 that the harness behind Claude Code had become useful far beyond coding, including deep research, video creation, and note-taking, and that the same harness could power many other kinds of agents.
- OpenAI's current agent docs emphasize reproducible agent evaluations and trace grading at the workflow level.

That combination is important:
- the industry is converging on tool-using agent loops,
- but evaluation and verification are becoming the real bottleneck,
- and coding-agent infrastructure is starting to generalize into broader agent infrastructure.

This is exactly why your "coding agents for non-coding domains" idea is worth mentioning.

## Bottom Line

If you want to sound aligned and impressive, the safest core message is:

> I am interested in agentic systems where evaluation, verification, and post-training all meet: long-horizon agents, rubric-based or contextual reward signals, software-engineering agents, and practical safety/oversight for real-world deployments.

That is specific, current, and highly consistent with Scale's recent work.
