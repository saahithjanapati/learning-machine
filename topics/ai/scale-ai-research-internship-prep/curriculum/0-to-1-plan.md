## Transcript Anchors

- Post-training needs reward signals that are useful beyond exact math/code verifiers.
- Open-ended post-training can improve quality while accidentally collapsing valid response diversity.
- Embedding spaces can turn semantic similarity, style distance, retrieval neighborhoods, and representation geometry into measurable signals for evaluation or post-training.
- Generated-token embeddings suggest that autoregressive generation can be a representation-forming trajectory, not only an output string.
- Natural-language activation explanations can turn hidden-state evidence into audit hypotheses, but must be corroborated before they become reward or monitor signals.
- Sparse feature spaces can provide candidate internal monitors or rewards, but reconstruction quality is not the same as robust interpretability.
- Matryoshka SAEs make the reconstruction-vs-feature-quality trade-off explicit by preserving high-level concepts that standard large dictionaries can absorb or split.
- Overcomplete sparse coding is the historical bridge from natural-signal statistics to interpretable-looking learned feature dictionaries.
- Thinking-model post-training may teach when to deploy latent reasoning mechanisms rather than building every mechanism from scratch.
- Post-training examples can act as evidence about the Assistant persona, so local reward design can have broad character-level generalization effects.
- A hidden same-model audit continuation is a proposed way to elicit latent knowledge, but it must beat separate evaluators on failures not visible in output text.
- MoReBench shows how expert rubrics can evaluate pluralistic moral reasoning as a process rather than reducing ambiguous dilemmas to answer keys.
- Positive alignment reframes evaluation around long-term human flourishing, autonomy support, and pluralistic value governance rather than only harm avoidance.
- Production traces can become external agent memory, but memory systems need benchmarks that test both useful retrieval and distracting retrieval.
- Interpretability can sometimes turn latent representations into monitors or rewards.
- Scale-style evaluation work often tries to make open-ended or long-horizon behavior measurable enough to improve.

## Outcome

- Build a compact reading map for internship preparation around post-training, interpretability, scalable supervision, and Scale Labs research themes.

## Modules

1. Post-training fundamentals: SFT, RL, RLVR, OPD, reward modeling, and post-training infrastructure.
2. Reward signals for open-ended tasks: rubrics, pairwise preferences, learned verifiers, and calibration targets.
3. Interpretability as supervision: probes, sparse features, activation readouts, embedding spaces, and feature rewards.
4. Agent and workflow evaluation: Scale Labs papers on rubrics, agent harnesses, long-horizon tasks, memory systems, and monitoring.
5. Research questions: when feature/rubric/embedding/memory signals are robust, when they are gameable, and how to audit the difference.
