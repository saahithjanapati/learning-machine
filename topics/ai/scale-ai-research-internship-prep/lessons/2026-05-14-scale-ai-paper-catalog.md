## What This Page Is

This is the simple list view of the Scale AI prep queue. The fuller [reading map](2026-05-14-scale-ai-papers-reading-map.md) explains how the papers fit together. This page is for quickly seeing what has already been done and where each item lives.

Items can naturally touch several themes. Each paper is listed once under the broad category where it is most useful for prep.

## Maintenance Rule

When adding a new Scale-relevant paper, update this catalog in the same change as the normal lesson/source ingest. Put the paper under one broad category, then update the [reading map](2026-05-14-scale-ai-papers-reading-map.md) only if the paper changes the recommended prep path.
