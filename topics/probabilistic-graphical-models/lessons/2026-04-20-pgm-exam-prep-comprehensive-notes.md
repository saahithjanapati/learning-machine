# Probabilistic Graphical Models: Slow-Teach Comprehensive Notes

This note is the front door to the full PGM exam-prep set.

The old version of this page treated the section notes mostly like a map.
This new version is for a very different use case:

- you missed class
- a lot of the vocabulary feels foreign
- you do not want compressed “smart person notes”
- you want something you can read straight through like a patient lecture transcript

So the whole note set should now be read with this mindset:

`we are not trying to sound concise or advanced; we are trying to make the ideas click`

Each section now also ends with:

- `Formal Anchors`: the precise statements, identities, and conditions worth knowing rigorously
- `Worked Problems`: fully solved exam-style questions collected in one place

There is now also a separate cross-cutting primer:

- `Math Machinery Primer`: the reusable algebra, information theory, calculus, linear algebra, Markov-chain, and causal-adjustment moves that keep appearing across the whole class

## How To Use These Notes

If you have not been going to class, the biggest mistake is trying to memorize isolated formulas before you know what problem each formula is solving.

If the notation itself feels foreign before the PGM idea even starts, begin with:

[[2026-04-22-pgm-exam-prep-math-machinery|Math Machinery Primer]]

So for each section, use this order:

1. read the opening “big picture” and slow explanation
2. make sure you can say in plain English what the section is about
3. only then worry about the formulas
4. then do the section's `Worked Problems`
5. only after that, move on

When you get stuck, do **not** immediately say “I am bad at this.”
Instead ask:

- what is the object here?
- what is the question?
- what is the graph buying me?
- what is the algorithm or theorem trying to compute?

Those four questions rescue a surprising amount of confusion.

## If You Are In Panic Mode

If the exam is close and you need the highest-value reading order, do this:

1. Math Machinery Primer if expectation, KL, gradients, or probability algebra feel shaky
2. Section 1 to understand what a graphical model even is
3. Section 2 to learn directed vs undirected models and the basic independence language
4. Section 3 because inference, elimination, treewidth, and BP are central
5. Section 5 and Section 6 because MCMC and VI are major algorithmic themes
6. Section 7 and Section 8 because late-course topics often show up as conceptual questions
7. Section 4 last, unless your practice material suggests GNNs are emphasized

If you are *really* short on time:

- Math Machinery Primer
- Section 2
- Section 3
- Section 5
- Section 6
- skim Section 7
- skim Section 8

## What These Notes Are Trying To Do

These notes are trying to teach three things at once:

### 1. What object the course is studying

The object is almost always a probability distribution over many variables.

### 2. Why the graph matters

The graph is there because the full distribution is too hard to store or compute with directly.

### 3. What the computational game is

Once the model is written down, the course keeps returning to the same questions:

- represent the distribution compactly
- compute marginals / MAP / partition functions / causal effects
- learn parameters
- approximate when exact computation is impossible

So if a section ever feels abstract, come back to this:

`representation -> inference -> approximation -> learning`

That is most of the class.

## Reading Order

### Math Machinery Primer

Read this first if the course notation itself still feels shaky.
It collects the reusable algebra and math moves that keep showing up across every major section:
probability algebra, expectations, entropy and KL, logs and partition functions, derivatives, Gaussian facts, Markov-chain basics, and causal-adjustment formulas.

[[2026-04-22-pgm-exam-prep-math-machinery]]

### Section 1. Foundations

Read this if you need the answer to:
what is a graphical model, and why are we doing any of this?

[[2026-04-20-pgm-exam-prep-section-01-foundations]]

### Section 2. Directed and Undirected Graphical Models

Read this if terms like DAG, collider, partition function, clique, and Markov blanket still feel slippery.

[[2026-04-20-pgm-exam-prep-section-02-directed-undirected]]

### Section 3. Exact Inference and Belief Propagation

Read this if you need to understand what exact inference is really accomplishing, and why tree structure matters so much.

[[2026-04-20-pgm-exam-prep-section-03-inference-bp]]

### Section 4. GNNs and the PGM Connection

Read this if you want the message-passing bridge from classical PGMs to modern graph learning.

[[2026-04-20-pgm-exam-prep-section-04-gnns]]

### Section 5. MCMC and Sampling

Read this if terms like stationary distribution, detailed balance, MH, Gibbs, HMC, and tempering still feel like disconnected vocabulary words.

[[2026-04-20-pgm-exam-prep-section-05-mcmc]]

### Section 6. Variational Inference, EM, and VAEs

Read this if ELBO, KL direction, mean-field, EM, and VAE training still feel abstract.

[[2026-04-20-pgm-exam-prep-section-06-vi-em-vae]]

### Section 7. GANs, Score Matching, NCE, and Diffusion

Read this if the late generative-model material feels like a blur of objective functions.

[[2026-04-20-pgm-exam-prep-section-07-generative-models]]

### Section 8. Causality and Discovery

Read this if you want a slower explanation of intervention, backdoor, front-door, PC, and what can or cannot be learned from observational data.
