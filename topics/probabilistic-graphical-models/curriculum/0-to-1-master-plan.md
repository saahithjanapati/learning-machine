## Starting Assumption

You are near 0 familiarity and need a full catch-up path from basics.

## Transcript Coverage Map

- `Lecture_1_intro.md`: course framing, probability/inference toolkit, approximate-inference motivation.
- `Lecture_2_directed.md`: Bayesian networks, DAG factorization, CPT structure, independence assumptions.
- `Lecture_3_4_undirected.md`: MRFs, potentials, partition function, Hammersley-Clifford, moralization bridge.
- `Lecture_5_inference.md` and `Lecture_6_7_beliefprop.md`: exact inference complexity, variable elimination, sum-product and max-product BP.
- `Lecture_8_GNNs.md`: graph message passing, GNN layer decomposition, expressivity limits, links to PGM intuition.
- `Lecture_9_MCMC_intro.md`: Markov chains, MH/Gibbs mechanics, stationary-distribution targeting.
- `Lecture_13_variational.md`: Gibbs variational principle, mean-field/CAVI, local-polytope outer relaxations, Bethe free energy, loopy-BP connection.
- `Lecture_15_EM.md`: ELBO, posterior approximation, EM vs variational inference, Gaussian-mixture updates, LDA-style variational EM.
- `Lecture_17_GAN.md` and `Lecture_18_applications.md`: adversarial training, JS/Wasserstein viewpoints, GAN pathologies, conditional GANs, and image-generation applications.
- `Lecture_19_scorematching.md`: score matching, denoising score matching, and Langevin-style sampling for EBMs.

Current late-course processed coverage is non-contiguous: the repo currently includes `Lecture 13`, `Lecture 15`, `Lecture 17`, `Lecture 18`, and `Lecture 19`, but not `Lectures 10-12`, `14`, or `16`.

## 0 -> 1 Definition

By the end, you should be able to:
- read and construct directed/undirected graphical models,
- derive conditional independencies and factorization structure,
- run core inference ideas (exact + message passing intuition),
- explain when and why MCMC is used,
- explain ELBO-style and Bethe-style variational approximations at a high level,
- describe EM / variational EM as alternating inference-learning procedures,
- contrast likelihood, adversarial, and score-matching training viewpoints,
- connect message passing intuition to GNN-style computations.

- Late (F-J): 35% exposition, 65% practice

## Assessment Gates

- Gate 1: write and explain a valid factorization for a small graph
- Gate 2: identify key conditional independence statements from structure
- Gate 3: explain exact inference complexity bottlenecks in plain language
- Gate 4: execute small-message-passing examples and sanity-check outputs
- Gate 5: explain MCMC motivation and failure modes at a high level
- Gate 6: derive the ELBO decomposition and explain EM vs variational EM
- Gate 7: compare GAN and score-matching training objectives without mixing them up
- Gate 8: explain how learned scores are converted into samples via Langevin updates
