Assistant response:
We are focusing on `HW3 Problem 3: KKT` in optimization.

I am using the same interactive setup as the earlier homework session:
- `learn`
- conceptual + short-answer
- `medium`
- one-at-a-time
- `hints-first`

Brief rundown of what you need for this problem:

### 1. Domain restrictions come first

Because the objective contains

$$
\ln(x_1) + \ln(x_2),
$$

the feasible domain must satisfy

$$
x_1 > 0, \quad x_2 > 0.
$$

That is not optional bookkeeping. It is part of the problem before any KKT algebra starts.

### 2. This is a constrained maximization problem

The problem is

$$
\max \; f(x_1,x_2)
$$

subject to one inequality and one equality:

$$
x_1x_2 \ge 4, \qquad 2x_1 = x_2.
$$

So the first real skill is converting the problem into a sign convention you can use consistently for KKT.

### 3. KKT is necessary here, not automatically sufficient

The homework explicitly says the problem is not convex.

So the right workflow is:
1. write the Lagrangian carefully,
2. solve the KKT system,
3. verify separately that the candidate is actually a maximum.

That last step matters. A KKT point is not automatically the optimizer in a nonconvex problem.

### 4. The equality constraint is a huge simplifier

Since

$$
x_2 = 2x_1,
$$

you can reduce the feasible set to essentially one variable.

That is often the cleanest way to verify the final candidate after solving KKT.

### 5. What you need to control in the algebra

The core ingredients are:
- primal feasibility
- dual feasibility
- complementary slackness
- stationarity

The usual mistakes are:
- wrong inequality sign in the Lagrangian,
- forgetting the log-domain constraints,
- finding a KKT point and stopping too early.

Session roadmap:
1. choose a consistent KKT sign convention,
2. identify the domain and active-feasibility structure,
3. write stationarity,
4. solve for KKT candidates,
5. verify the actual maximum.

### Q1
Before we write any Lagrangian, what restrictions do the logs and the equality constraint immediately impose on the feasible set?

Answer in 1-3 lines. I will grade it immediately and then we will build the KKT system.

---
### Turn 2
User asked:
> The equality constraint lets us write it as one variable and the logs say that X1 and X2 have to both be positive.

Assistant response:
Correct core idea.

Precision upgrade:
- the logs force

$$
x_1 > 0, \qquad x_2 > 0
$$

- the equality constraint gives

$$
x_2 = 2x_1
$$

So the feasible set already lies on a single positive ray. That is exactly the right starting picture.

One more quick simplification before KKT:

If you plug

$$
x_2 = 2x_1
$$

into the inequality

$$
x_1x_2 \ge 4,
$$

what does that imply about the allowed values of $x_1$?

Answer with the simplified inequality and the final lower bound on $x_1$.

---
### Turn 3
User asked:
> We get the condition that x1 squared is less than or equal to 2, or x1 is greater than the square root of 2.

Assistant response:
Very close. The final lower bound you stated is right, but there is a sign slip in the intermediate inequality.

Starting from

$$
x_1x_2 \ge 4
$$

and using

$$
x_2 = 2x_1,
$$

we get

$$
2x_1^2 \ge 4
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
x_1^2 \ge 2.
$$

Since the logs already force $x_1 > 0$, this becomes

$$
x_1 \ge \sqrt{2}.
$$

So the feasible set is the ray

$$
x_1 \ge \sqrt{2}, \qquad x_2 = 2x_1.
$$

Now let us set up KKT cleanly using the standard minimization convention.

If we convert the problem to minimizing $-f(x)$ and want the inequality in the form

$$
g(x) \le 0,
$$

what should we choose for $g(x)$ to represent the constraint

$$
x_1x_2 \ge 4?
$$

Just give the expression for $g(x)$.

---
### Turn 4
User asked:
> It would be 4 minus x1 x2.

Assistant response:
Yes. Correct.

Using the standard minimization-form KKT convention, we take

$$
g(x_1,x_2) = 4 - x_1x_2 \le 0.
$$

For the equality constraint, we can use

$$
h(x_1,x_2) = 2x_1 - x_2 = 0.
$$

So if

$$
F(x_1,x_2) =
-x_1^2 + 4x_1 - \frac{3}{2}x_2^2 + 7x_2 - x_1x_2 - 9 + \ln(x_1) + \ln(x_2),
$$

then we convert to minimizing

$$
\phi(x_1,x_2) = -F(x_1,x_2).
$$

### Q2
Using

$$
L(x,\lambda,\nu)=\phi(x)+\lambda g(x)+\nu h(x),
\qquad \lambda \ge 0,
$$

write out the full Lagrangian explicitly.

You can leave it expanded or partially factored, but it should have the correct signs.

---
### Turn 5
User asked:
> /Users/saahithjanapati/Downloads/IMG_7286.heic this is what i have

Assistant response:
Your setup is basically correct.

What you got right:
- the sign flip from maximizing $F$ to minimizing $\phi=-F$
- the inequality term

$$
\lambda(4-x_1x_2)
$$

- the equality term

$$
\nu(2x_1-x_2)
$$

So the Lagrangian itself is

$$
L(x_1,x_2,\lambda,\nu)
=
x_1^2 - 4x_1 + \frac{3}{2}x_2^2 - 7x_2 + x_1x_2 + 9
- \ln(x_1) - \ln(x_2)
+ \lambda(4-x_1x_2)
+ \nu(2x_1-x_2).
$$

One correction:
- do **not** set the Lagrangian itself equal to zero

What gets set to zero are the stationarity derivatives:

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_1}=0,
\qquad
\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_2}=0.
$$

### Q3
Can you now compute

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_1}
$$

and write it as a single equation equal to zero?

---
### Turn 6
User asked:
> /Users/saahithjanapati/Downloads/IMG_7287.HEIC this is what i have

Assistant response:
That derivative is correct.

You have

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_1}
=
2x_1 - 4 + x_2 - \frac{1}{x_1} - \lambda x_2 + 2\nu.
$$

So the first stationarity equation is

$$
2x_1 - 4 + x_2 - \frac{1}{x_1} - \lambda x_2 + 2\nu = 0.
$$

That is exactly right.

Small notation correction from the page:
- the constraint is still

$$
x_1x_2 \ge 4,
$$

not $x_1,x_2 \ge 4$.

### Q4
Now compute

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_2}
$$

and set it equal to zero.

---
### Turn 7
User asked:
> /Users/saahithjanapati/Downloads/IMG_7288.HEIC

Assistant response:
That derivative is also correct.

From

$$
L(x_1,x_2,\lambda,\nu)
=
x_1^2 - 4x_1 + \frac{3}{2}x_2^2 - 7x_2 + x_1x_2 + 9
- \ln(x_1) - \ln(x_2)
+ \lambda(4-x_1x_2)
+ \nu(2x_1-x_2),
$$

we get

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_2}
=
3x_2 - 7 + x_1 - \frac{1}{x_2} - \lambda x_1 - \nu.
$$

So the second stationarity equation is

$$
3x_2 - 7 + x_1 - \frac{1}{x_2} - \lambda x_1 - \nu = 0.
$$

At this point, your stationarity part is in good shape.

### Q5
Now write the remaining KKT pieces:

1. primal feasibility,
2. dual feasibility,
3. complementary slackness.

Just list the equations/inequality conditions. No solving yet.

---
### Turn 8
User asked:
> /Users/saahithjanapati/Downloads/IMG_7289.HEIC are these correct?

Assistant response:
Mostly yes. The structure is right:

- primal feasibility
- dual feasibility
- complementary slackness

But one primal-feasibility line needs correction.

Correct version:

### Primal feasibility

$$
x_1x_2 \ge 4,
\qquad
2x_1 - x_2 = 0,
\qquad
x_1 > 0,\; x_2 > 0.
$$

So:
- it is **not** $x_1, x_2 \ge 4$
- it is the product constraint $x_1x_2 \ge 4$
- for the logs, use strict positivity, not just $\ge 0$

### Dual feasibility

$$
\lambda \ge 0.
$$

### Complementary slackness

$$
\lambda(4-x_1x_2)=0.
$$

So your KKT framework is now essentially complete.

### Q6
Use the equality constraint immediately:

$$
x_2 = 2x_1.
$$

Substitute that into **both** stationarity equations and write the simplified two equations in terms of $x_1,\lambda,\nu$ only.

---
### Turn 9
User asked:
> /Users/saahithjanapati/Downloads/IMG_7290.HEIC how is this?

Assistant response:
This is basically correct.

After substituting

$$
x_2=2x_1,
$$

the first stationarity equation becomes

$$
2x_1 - 4 + 2x_1 - \frac{1}{x_1} - 2\lambda x_1 + 2\nu = 0,
$$

which simplifies to

$$
4x_1 - 4 - \frac{1}{x_1} - 2\lambda x_1 + 2\nu = 0.
$$

The second becomes

$$
6x_1 - 7 + x_1 - \frac{1}{2x_1} - \lambda x_1 - \nu = 0,
$$

which simplifies to

$$
7x_1 - 7 - \frac{1}{2x_1} - \lambda x_1 - \nu = 0.
$$

So your substitution step is right.

One cleanup:
- complementary slackness should be

$$
\lambda(4-x_1x_2)=0,
$$

not an inequality.

Using $x_2=2x_1$, that becomes

$$
\lambda(4-2x_1^2)=0.
$$

### Q7
What are the two cases implied by

$$
\lambda(4-2x_1^2)=0
$$

together with

$$
\lambda \ge 0,\qquad x_1 \ge \sqrt{2}?
$$

Just state the two cases. No algebra yet.

---
### Turn 10
User asked:
> One case is that lambda is equal to zero and then the other case is that lambda is not equal to zero in which case two x one squared equals four or x one equals two.

Assistant response:
Yes on the structure. That is the right case split.

Case 1:

$$
\lambda = 0.
$$

Case 2:

$$
4 - 2x_1^2 = 0.
$$

Small arithmetic correction:

$$
4 - 2x_1^2 = 0
\;\Longrightarrow\;
2x_1^2 = 4
\;\Longrightarrow\;
x_1^2 = 2.
$$

Since $x_1>0$, this gives

$$
x_1 = \sqrt{2},
$$

not $x_1=2$.

So the two cases are:

1. $\\lambda = 0$
2. $x_1 = \sqrt{2}$  (active inequality case)

### Q8
Which case do you think is easier to test first, and why?

Give a one-line answer, then we will solve that case completely.

---
### Turn 11
User asked:
> I am not exactly sure... Wait, so when you say test, what do you mean exactly? Do you mean the... Like, basically do we need to plug it into the stationarity equations?

Assistant response:
Yes. Exactly.

Here, "test a case" means:

1. assume the case condition,
- for example $\\lambda=0$ or $x_1=\\sqrt{2}$

2. plug that assumption into the reduced stationarity equations,

3. solve for the remaining unknowns,

4. check the rest of KKT and then later compare candidates.

So yes, the immediate next move is substitution into the stationarity equations.

The easier case to start with is usually

$$
x_1 = \sqrt{2},
$$

because then $x_2=2\sqrt{2}$ immediately, and the only unknowns left are $\\lambda$ and $\\nu$.

### Q9
Let us do that case.

Assume

$$
x_1=\sqrt{2}, \qquad x_2=2\sqrt{2}.
$$

Substitute into the two reduced stationarity equations:

$$
4x_1 - 4 - \frac{1}{x_1} - 2\lambda x_1 + 2\nu = 0
$$

and

$$
7x_1 - 7 - \frac{1}{2x_1} - \lambda x_1 - \nu = 0.
$$

What two linear equations in $\\lambda$ and $\\nu$ do you get?

---
### Turn 12
User asked:
> /Users/saahithjanapati/Downloads/IMG_7291.HEIC how are these?

Assistant response:
These are basically fine.

For the first reduced stationarity equation,

$$
4x_1 - 4 - \frac{1}{x_1} - 2\lambda x_1 + 2\nu = 0,
$$

plugging in $x_1=\sqrt{2}$ gives

$$
4\sqrt{2} - 4 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - 2\sqrt{2}\lambda + 2\nu = 0.
$$

If you multiply both sides by $\\sqrt{2}$, this becomes

$$
7 - 4\sqrt{2} - 4\lambda + 2\sqrt{2}\nu = 0.
$$

So your first boxed equation is equivalent to the correct one.

For the second reduced stationarity equation,

$$
7x_1 - 7 - \frac{1}{2x_1} - \lambda x_1 - \nu = 0,
$$

plugging in $x_1=\sqrt{2}$ gives

$$
7\sqrt{2} - 7 - \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} - \sqrt{2}\lambda - \nu = 0.
$$

That is also correct.

So yes, the substitution step is in good shape.

To make the solve easier, a clean pair to use is:

$$
4\sqrt{2} - 4 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - 2\sqrt{2}\lambda + 2\nu = 0
$$

and

$$
7\sqrt{2} - 7 - \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} - \sqrt{2}\lambda - \nu = 0.
$$

### Q10
Now solve this $2 \times 2$ system for $\\lambda$ and $\\nu$.

You can eliminate either variable first. Give me the values you get.

---
### Turn 13
User asked:
> Wait, how did you get rid of the seven in the top one?

Assistant response:
I did not get rid of a $7$ that was already there.

The $7$ is created when we multiply the whole equation by $\\sqrt{2}$.

Start from

$$
4\sqrt{2} - 4 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - 2\sqrt{2}\lambda + 2\nu = 0.
$$

Now multiply every term by $\\sqrt{2}$:

$$
\sqrt{2}(4\sqrt{2}) - 4\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{2}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) - 4\lambda + 2\sqrt{2}\nu = 0.
$$

Compute the easy products:

$$
8 - 4\sqrt{2} - 1 - 4\lambda + 2\sqrt{2}\nu = 0.
$$

Then combine $8-1=7$:

$$
7 - 4\sqrt{2} - 4\lambda + 2\sqrt{2}\nu = 0.
$$

So the $7$ comes from

$$
4\sqrt{2}\cdot \sqrt{2} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\cdot \sqrt{2} = 8 - 1 = 7.
$$

If you want, you do **not** need to multiply by $\\sqrt{2}$ at all. You can solve directly from

$$
4\sqrt{2} - 4 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - 2\sqrt{2}\lambda + 2\nu = 0.
$$

### Q10 (same step)
Do you want to solve the system in the original form, or in the cleared-denominator form?

---
### Turn 14
User asked:
> /Users/saahithjanapati/Downloads/IMG_7292.HEIC how is this?

Assistant response:
Mostly good.

Your value for $\\nu$ is correct:

$$
\nu = \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{2} - \frac{5}{2}
= \frac{5}{2}(\sqrt{2}-1).
$$

For $\\lambda$, the clean elimination is:

From

$$
4\sqrt{2} - 4 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - 2\sqrt{2}\lambda + 2\nu = 0
$$

we get

$$
2\sqrt{2}\lambda - 2\nu = 4\sqrt{2} - 4 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
$$

From

$$
7\sqrt{2} - 7 - \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} - \sqrt{2}\lambda - \nu = 0
$$

we get

$$
\sqrt{2}\lambda + \nu = 7\sqrt{2} - 7 - \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}.
$$

Now double the second equation and add:

$$
\big(2\sqrt{2}\lambda - 2\nu\big)
+ \big(2\sqrt{2}\lambda + 2\nu\big)
=
\left(4\sqrt{2} - 4 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)
+ \left(14\sqrt{2} - 14 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right).
$$

So

$$
4\sqrt{2}\lambda = 18\sqrt{2} - 18 - \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}}
= 17\sqrt{2} - 18.
$$

Hence

$$
\lambda = \frac{17\sqrt{2} - 18}{4\sqrt{2}}
= \frac{17 - 9\sqrt{2}}{4}.
$$

That is positive, so this active-constraint case is consistent with dual feasibility.

So one KKT candidate is:

$$
x_1=\sqrt{2}, \qquad x_2=2\sqrt{2},
$$

with

$$
\lambda = \frac{17 - 9\sqrt{2}}{4},
\qquad
\nu = \frac{5}{2}(\sqrt{2}-1).
$$

### Q11
Now test the other case:

$$
\lambda = 0.
$$

Use the reduced stationarity equations and eliminate $\\nu$.

What equation in $x_1$ do you get?

---
### Turn 15
User asked:
> i get 18x1^2 - 18x - 2 = 0

Assistant response:
You are right to question that. The previous sign flip on $\\nu$ was wrong.

For the case

$$
\lambda=0,
$$

the reduced stationarity equations are

$$
4x_1 - 4 - \frac{1}{x_1} + 2\nu = 0
$$

and

$$
7x_1 - 7 - \frac{1}{2x_1} - \nu = 0.
$$

From the first,

$$
2\nu = -4x_1 + 4 + \frac{1}{x_1}.
$$

From the second, the correct isolation is

$$
\nu = 7x_1 - 7 - \frac{1}{2x_1},
$$

so

$$
2\nu = 14x_1 - 14 - \frac{1}{x_1}.
$$

Now set the two expressions for $2\nu$ equal:

$$
-4x_1 + 4 + \frac{1}{x_1}
=
14x_1 - 14 - \frac{1}{x_1}.
$$

Rearranging gives

$$
18x_1 - 18 - \frac{2}{x_1} = 0.
$$

Multiplying by $x_1>0$:

$$
18x_1^2 - 18x_1 - 2 = 0,
$$

so your quadratic was correct.

### Q12
Solve

$$
18x_1^2 - 18x_1 - 2 = 0.
$$

Which root is feasible under

$$
x_1 \ge \sqrt{2}?
$$

Then compare that case with the active-constraint case $x_1=\sqrt{2}$.

---
### Turn 16
User asked:
> I don't think there is a root that's feasible.

Assistant response:
Correct.

The quadratic is

$$
9x_1^2 - 9x_1 - 1 = 0,
$$

so the roots are

$$
x_1 = \frac{9 \pm \sqrt{81+36}}{18}
= \frac{9 \pm \sqrt{117}}{18}
= \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{13}}{6}.
$$

Numerically:

$$
\frac{3+\sqrt{13}}{6} \approx 1.10,
\qquad
\frac{3-\sqrt{13}}{6} < 0.
$$

But primal feasibility requires

$$
x_1 \ge \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414.
$$

So neither root is feasible.

That means the $\\lambda=0$ branch is impossible, and the **only feasible KKT candidate** is

$$
x_1=\sqrt{2}, \qquad x_2=2\sqrt{2}.
$$

Now we just need to verify this candidate is actually a maximum.

The cleanest way is to reduce to one variable using the equality constraint.

### Q13
Define

$$
\psi(t)=F(t,2t).
$$

Can you write $\\psi(t)$ explicitly?

---
### Turn 17
User asked:
> I get 9t^2 - 18t + 9 - lnt - lnt2t.

Assistant response:
Very close, but the signs flip here because for the verification step we are reducing the original **maximization** objective $F$, not the minimization-form function $\\phi=-F$.

Start from

$$
F(x_1,x_2)
=
-x_1^2 + 4x_1 - \frac{3}{2}x_2^2 + 7x_2 - x_1x_2 - 9 + \ln(x_1) + \ln(x_2).
$$

Now plug in

$$
x_1=t, \qquad x_2=2t.
$$

Then

$$
\psi(t)=F(t,2t)
=
-t^2 + 4t - \frac{3}{2}(2t)^2 + 7(2t) - t(2t) - 9 + \ln(t) + \ln(2t).
$$

Simplifying the polynomial terms:

$$
-t^2 - 6t^2 - 2t^2 + 4t + 14t - 9
=
-9t^2 + 18t - 9.
$$

So the reduced objective is

$$
\psi(t)= -9t^2 + 18t - 9 + \ln(t) + \ln(2t).
$$

Equivalently,

$$
\psi(t)= -9(t-1)^2 + \ln(2t^2).
$$

with feasible domain

$$
t \ge \sqrt{2}.
$$

### Q14
Now differentiate $\\psi(t)$.

What are

$$
\psi'(t)
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\psi''(t)?
$$

---
### Turn 18
User asked:
> Times t minus 1 in parentheses plus 4t times 1 over 2t squared for the first derivative, or 9, 18 minus 2 over t squared for the second derivative.

Assistant response:
Very close. The logarithm derivative idea is fine, but there is a sign mistake in the quadratic part.

We had

$$
\psi(t)= -9(t-1)^2 + \ln(2t^2).
$$

Differentiate term by term.

For the quadratic part:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\big[-9(t-1)^2\big] = -18(t-1).
$$

For the log part:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\ln(2t^2)
= \frac{1}{2t^2}\cdot 4t
= \frac{2}{t}.
$$

So

$$
\psi'(t)= -18(t-1) + \frac{2}{t}
= -18t + 18 + \frac{2}{t}.
$$

Differentiate again:

$$
\psi''(t)= -18 - \frac{2}{t^2}.
$$

So the only fix is:
- first derivative should start with $-18(t-1)$, not $+18(t-1)$
- second derivative should be

$$
-18 - \frac{2}{t^2},
$$

not $18 - 2/t^2$.

### Q15
What does

$$
\psi''(t)= -18 - \frac{2}{t^2}
$$

tell you about the shape of $\\psi$ on the feasible region $t \ge \sqrt{2}$?

Answer in one sentence.

---
### Turn 19
User asked:
> It's always going to be negative, which means that it's concave down, or if the second derivative is negative, yeah, it's going to be concave down, so it's not a minimizer, it's a maximizing.

Assistant response:
Yes, the key idea is right.

More precise version:

$$
\psi''(t) = -18 - \frac{2}{t^2} < 0
\qquad\text{for all } t>0,
$$

so $\\psi$ is **strictly concave** on the whole feasible region.

That means:
- it cannot have an interior local minimum,
- any interior critical point would be a strict maximum,
- and on the interval $t \ge \sqrt{2}$, the global maximum is determined by either a feasible critical point or the boundary.

Now check the derivative:

$$
\psi'(t)= -18t + 18 + \frac{2}{t}.
$$

Its zero solves

$$
18t^2 - 18t - 2 = 0
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
t = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{13}}{6}.
$$

The only positive root is

$$
\frac{3+\sqrt{13}}{6} \approx 1.10,
$$

which is **less** than $\\sqrt{2}$, so it is not feasible.

Since $\\psi$ is strictly concave, $\\psi'$ is strictly decreasing. Therefore once we are at the feasible boundary $t=\\sqrt{2}$, the derivative is already negative and stays negative for all larger $t$.

So $\\psi$ is decreasing on

$$
[\sqrt{2},\infty),
$$

which means the maximum is attained at the left endpoint:

$$
t^* = \sqrt{2}.
$$

Therefore

$$
x_1^*=\sqrt{2}, \qquad x_2^*=2\sqrt{2}.
$$

### Q16
Can you now write the final one-paragraph homework-style conclusion:
- the optimizer,
- the multipliers,
- and one sentence explaining why this KKT point is indeed the maximum?

### Turn 20
User asked:
> the optimizer is at point x1 which is square root 2 and 2 square root 2. The multipliers for this choice was like the lambda and v that we calculated, which was 5 over 2 square root 2 minus 5 over 2 and 17 minus 9 square root 2 all over 4. And then, so like, basically, the way we arrived at this was by following through the KKT complementary slack conditions. And so this specific point was the point that we got when we set x1 equals square root 2 and x2 equals 2 square root 2, which meant that the constraints went to the constraints on the inequality went to 0. So lambda could be whatever it wanted. And then on the other hand, when we set lambda to 0, we were unable to really solve the kind of, like, the quadratic that we ended up getting did not have a, it was always decreasing on the feasible set. And so there was no kind of like, and then we also checked on the endpoints, whether it was greater than what we had with the point that we found before and it was not. So that means that the point that we found when we set lambda equals 0 is the, sorry, when we set the inequality to 0, that's the maximizer. Is that right?

Assistant response:
That is mostly right. The main conclusion is correct, but I would tighten three pieces for a homework writeup:

1. Label the multipliers clearly:

$$
\lambda^* = \frac{17-9\sqrt{2}}{4},
\qquad
\nu^* = \frac{5}{2}(\sqrt{2}-1).
$$

2. If the inequality is active, complementary slackness gives

$$
\lambda(4-x_1x_2)=0
$$

automatically, but that does **not** mean $\\lambda$ is arbitrary. It still has to satisfy stationarity, and that is what determines its value.

3. In the $\\lambda=0$ branch, we **could** solve the quadratic. The result was that its roots were not feasible, so that branch yields no feasible KKT point.

A clean final paragraph is:

> Using KKT, we rewrite the inequality as $g(x)=4-x_1x_2\\le 0$ and the equality as $h(x)=2x_1-x_2=0$. Solving the stationarity, feasibility, dual-feasibility, and complementary-slackness conditions gives one feasible KKT point:

> The branch $\\lambda=0$ leads to the quadratic $18x_1^2-18x_1-2=0$, whose roots are infeasible because they do not satisfy $x_1\\ge \sqrt{2}$. To verify optimality, use the equality constraint to reduce the problem to
> $$
> \psi(t)=F(t,2t)=-9t^2+18t-9+\ln(t)+\ln(2t), \qquad t\ge \sqrt{2}.

> the reduced objective is strictly concave on the feasible region. Its only positive critical point is $t=(3+\sqrt{13})/6<\sqrt{2}$, so there is no feasible interior critical point. Therefore $\\psi$ is decreasing on $[\\sqrt{2},\infty)$, and the global maximum is attained at $t=\sqrt{2}$. Hence
