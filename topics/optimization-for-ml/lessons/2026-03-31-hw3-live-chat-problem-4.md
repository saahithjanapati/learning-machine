### Turn 1
User asked:
> Can you explain what is needed for the...um...what is needed for question 4 of homework 3?

Assistant response:
Yes. `HW3 Problem 4` is mostly a **modeling + duality** problem, not a long theorem problem.

What you need is this:

## Big picture

You are given sampled values

$$
f(0),f(1),\dots,f(N-1),
$$

and you want a **convex piecewise-linear approximation** $g$ whose sampled values are

$$
g_0,g_1,\dots,g_{N-1}.
$$

You are minimizing total absolute error:

$$
\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} |g_i-f(i)|.
$$

So the problem is asking:

1. How do I encode **convexity** using only linear constraints on the sampled values $g_i$?
2. How do I encode **absolute values** in an LP?
3. How do I write and interpret the **dual**?

## What part (a) needs

There are two standard tricks.

### 1. Encode convexity discretely

For a piecewise-linear function on equally spaced grid points, convexity means the slopes do not decrease:

$$
g_{i+1}-g_i \;\ge\; g_i-g_{i-1}.
$$

Equivalently,

$$
g_{i+1}-2g_i+g_{i-1} \ge 0
\qquad \text{for } i=1,\dots,N-2.
$$

That is the core convexity constraint.

### 2. Linearize the absolute values

Introduce nonnegative error variables, say $e_i \ge 0$, and enforce

$$
g_i-f(i) \le e_i,
\qquad
f(i)-g_i \le e_i.
$$

Then minimizing

$$
\sum_i e_i
$$

is the same as minimizing

$$
\sum_i |g_i-f(i)|.
$$

So the primal LP is:
- variables: $g_i$ and $e_i$
- objective: minimize $\sum_i e_i$
- constraints:
  - two linear inequalities per absolute value
  - one convexity inequality per interior index
  - $e_i \ge 0$

That is the full modeling content of part (a).

## What part (b) needs

Part (b) is about the dual, but the main point is not just symbol pushing.

You should expect:
- one family of dual variables for the upper/lower error constraints
- one family of dual variables for the convexity constraints
- nonnegativity restrictions for dual variables attached to `<=` constraints

Interpretation:
- the dual variables on the error constraints measure pressure from fitting the data
- the dual variables on the convexity constraints measure where the convexity requirement is binding

Geometrically, an active convexity constraint means the local discrete slope change is exactly at the convexity boundary there.

## What to remember before solving

- piecewise-linear convexity on a grid = nondecreasing slopes
- absolute value in LP = auxiliary nonnegative variable with two inequalities
- dual variables correspond to primal constraints
- active convexity multipliers tell you where the shape constraint matters

If you want, next I can do either:

1. a clean walkthrough of part `(a)` only, or
2. derive the actual primal LP and dual with you step by step.

---
### Turn 2
User asked:
> Wait, what are the main topics that I need to understand in order to solve this problem?

Assistant response:
Yes. The shortest honest answer is: you need **convexity on a discrete grid, LP modeling tricks, and basic duality interpretation**.

Here is the real topic stack.

## Must-know topics

### 1. Convex piecewise-linear functions

You need to know what convexity means when a function is represented only by sampled values on grid points.

Core fact:

$$
\text{convex on the grid}
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
\text{slopes do not decrease}.
$$

So you should be comfortable moving between:

$$
g_{i+1}-g_i \ge g_i-g_{i-1}
$$

and

$$
g_{i+1}-2g_i+g_{i-1} \ge 0.
$$

If this part is shaky, the whole problem feels mysterious.

### 2. Absolute-value linearization

The objective uses

$$
|g_i-f(i)|.
$$

An LP cannot keep absolute values directly in the objective, so you need the standard trick:
- introduce an error variable $e_i \ge 0$
- force it to dominate both signs of the deviation

$$
g_i-f(i)\le e_i,\qquad f(i)-g_i\le e_i.
$$

That is a standard modeling pattern.

### 3. Linear programming formulation

You should be comfortable with the idea:
- choose decision variables
- write a linear objective
- write all constraints as linear inequalities/equalities

For this problem, the variables are basically:
- the approximation values $g_i$
- the error variables $e_i$

So this is more about modeling than about calculus.

### 4. LP duality basics

For part `(b)`, you need basic comfort with:
- primal constraints producing dual variables
- sign restrictions on dual variables
- the dual objective/constraints coming from reorganizing the primal Lagrangian or LP form

You do **not** need deep duality philosophy, but you do need to know how to read what a dual variable is attached to.

### 5. Interpreting active constraints

You should understand what it means when a convexity constraint is tight:

$$
g_{i+1}-2g_i+g_{i-1}=0.
$$

Geometrically, that means the local slope change is exactly at the convexity boundary there.

That matters for the interpretation part of `(b)`.

## Helpful but secondary topics

These help, but are not the true bottlenecks:
- piecewise-linear geometry intuition
- sensitivity interpretation of dual variables
- complementary slackness language

## What this problem is **not** mainly testing

It is not mainly about:
- KKT solving
- gradients/Hessians
- stochastic methods
- heavy convex-analysis theorems

It is mostly:
- discrete convexity,
- LP modeling,
- dual interpretation.

## If I compress it to three bullets

You need to know:
1. how to express convexity on sampled points,
2. how to turn absolute values into linear constraints,
3. how to read dual variables as prices on constraints.

If you want, next I can turn this into a **minimal prerequisite checklist** or go directly into **part (a)** and build the LP line by line.

---
### Turn 3
User asked:
> i don't even understand what it's asking... can you break it down a bit more?

Assistant response:
Yes. The most important clarification is:

This problem is **not** asking you to compute a specific approximation from actual numbers.

It is asking you to write down the **optimization problem** that *would* find the best convex approximation.

So think of it as:
- "set up the machine,"
- not "run the machine on data."

## What they give you

They give you sampled values of some function:

$$
f(0), f(1), f(2), \dots, f(N-1).
$$

You should imagine these as fixed numbers.

## What you are allowed to choose

You are allowed to choose a new function $g$.

But instead of describing the whole function continuously, you only choose its values at the same grid points:

$$
g_0, g_1, g_2, \dots, g_{N-1}.
$$

Then you imagine connecting consecutive points with straight lines.

That is what "piecewise linear" means here.

So if you pick the values $g_i$, you have already defined the approximation function.

## What "best approximation" means

They define the fitting error as

$$
\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} |g_i - f(i)|.
$$

So at each sample point:
- compare your chosen value $g_i$
- to the given data value $f(i)$
- take the absolute difference
- add them all up

So the goal is:

Choose the values $g_i$ so that:
1. the resulting piecewise-linear function is convex,
2. the total absolute error is as small as possible.

## What convex means in this setting

Because the function is piecewise linear on equally spaced points, convexity becomes:

the slope from point $i-1$ to $i$ cannot be bigger than the slope from $i$ to $i+1$.

In other words, slopes are allowed to stay the same or increase, but not decrease.

That is why this becomes a linear-constraint problem.

## What part (a) is literally asking

Part `(a)` says:

"Write a linear program whose solution would produce those best values $g_i$."

That means you need to specify:
- the decision variables
- the objective
- the constraints

Concretely:
- decision variables: the $g_i$ and some error variables
- objective: minimize total error
- constraints:
  - make the errors represent absolute values
  - make the $g_i$ define a convex sequence

You are **not** asked to solve the LP numerically.

## What part (b) is literally asking

Part `(b)` says:

"Now write the dual of the LP from part (a), and explain what those dual variables mean."

So this is not a new modeling problem from scratch.
It is:
1. take your primal LP from part `(a)`,
2. derive its dual,
3. interpret the dual variables.

## Tiny mental picture

Imagine the original data points wiggle up and down.

You are trying to draw the closest broken-line curve through new heights $g_i$ such that the curve is always "bending upward" like a convex shape.

If the raw data is non-convex, your chosen $g_i$ will smooth that into the nearest convex profile.

## The one-sentence summary

This problem is asking:

"How do I formulate an LP that finds the closest convex piecewise-linear fit to sampled data, and what does the dual of that LP mean?"

If you want, next I can do one of two things:

1. translate that directly into the actual variables/objective/constraints for part `(a)`, or
2. give a tiny 4-point toy example first so the setup feels concrete.

---
### Turn 4
User asked:
> Okay, so I assume that the... I assume that the thing that we're minimizing is like the sum of the linear, like absolute value differences. And then the constraints would be, I guess in terms of the values of g_i, it would be like, I mean, the slope between point i minus one and i is less than or equal to the slope from point i to i plus one, but I'm not exactly sure how to like formalize that. Is this like on the right track so far?

Assistant response:
Yes. That is exactly the right track.

You already have the two core ideas of part `(a)`:

1. objective = total absolute error
2. constraints = enforce convexity through nondecreasing slopes

The only missing piece is writing the slope condition as a linear inequality.

Because the sample points are at equally spaced locations

$$
0,1,2,\dots,N-1,
$$

the slope from $i-1$ to $i$ is

$$
\frac{g_i-g_{i-1}}{i-(i-1)} = g_i-g_{i-1},
$$

and the slope from $i$ to $i+1$ is

$$
\frac{g_{i+1}-g_i}{(i+1)-i} = g_{i+1}-g_i.
$$

So convexity means

$$
g_i-g_{i-1} \le g_{i+1}-g_i
\qquad \text{for } i=1,\dots,N-2.
$$

Now move everything to one side:

$$
g_{i+1}-2g_i+g_{i-1} \ge 0.
$$

That is the formal linear convexity constraint.

So yes, your structure is already correct:

## Variables

- $g_0,\dots,g_{N-1}$
- plus error variables $e_0,\dots,e_{N-1}$

## Objective

$$
\min \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} e_i
$$

where $e_i$ will stand in for $|g_i-f(i)|$.

## Constraints

### Absolute value constraints

$$
g_i-f(i)\le e_i,
\qquad
f(i)-g_i\le e_i,
\qquad
e_i\ge 0.
$$

### Convexity constraints

$$
g_{i+1}-2g_i+g_{i-1}\ge 0
\qquad \text{for } i=1,\dots,N-2.
$$

So conceptually, you are already there.

### Q1
Do you want to try writing the full primal LP now in one clean block, or do you want me to write it once and then explain each line?

---
### Turn 5
User asked:
> /Users/saahithjanapati/Downloads/IMG_7321.HEIC does this look correct?

Assistant response:
Yes, the structure is mostly correct. You clearly have the right idea.

What is already right:

- objective is minimizing total error
- you introduced error variables $e_i$
- you wrote the two inequalities that make $e_i$ upper-bound both signs of the deviation
- you are trying to encode convexity with the discrete second-difference constraint

There are just a few important fixes:

## Fix 1: do not define $e_i$ as an absolute value

In the LP, $e_i$ should be a decision variable, not a definition

So instead of writing

$$
e_i := |g_i-f(i)|,
$$

write:

$$
e_i \ge 0
$$

and enforce

$$
g_i-f(i)\le e_i,
\qquad
f(i)-g_i\le e_i.
$$

Those constraints make $e_i$ act like $|g_i-f(i)|$ at optimality.

## Fix 2: make the convexity inequality explicit

Your convexity line should include the inequality sign.

The clean version is

$$
g_{i+1}-2g_i+g_{i-1}\ge 0
\qquad \text{for } i=1,\dots,N-2.
$$

Equivalently, you could write

$$
2g_i-g_{i+1}-g_{i-1}\le 0.
$$

Either is fine, but one of those exact forms should appear.

## Fix 3: include $e_i \ge 0$

That nonnegativity constraint should be stated explicitly for all $i$.

## Clean primal LP

A clean writeup for part `(a)` is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{g_0,\dots,g_{N-1},\, e_0,\dots,e_{N-1}}
\quad & \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} e_i \\
\text{s.t.}\quad
& g_i - f(i) \le e_i, \qquad i=0,\dots,N-1, \\
& f(i) - g_i \le e_i, \qquad i=0,\dots,N-1, \\
& g_{i+1} - 2g_i + g_{i-1} \ge 0, \qquad i=1,\dots,N-2, \\
& e_i \ge 0, \qquad i=0,\dots,N-1.
\end{aligned}
$$

That is a correct primal LP formulation.

So: yes, you are on the right track. The main issue is just to treat $e_i$ as LP variables with constraints, not as a direct absolute-value definition.

### Q2
Do you want to clean up part `(a)` fully first, or move on to what the dual in part `(b)` should look like?

---
### Turn 6
User asked:
> Does every LP have like decision variables where you specify that they must be greater than or equal to zero? Or are some of them like equality?

Assistant response:
Good question. No, **not every decision variable in an LP must be nonnegative** in the original modeling statement.

What is true is:

## 1. Constraints and variables are different things

- **variables** are the unknown quantities you choose
- **constraints** tell you what values they are allowed to take

So an equality like

$$
x_1 + x_2 = 3
$$

is a **constraint**, not a type of variable.

## 2. Variables can have different sign restrictions

A variable can be:

- nonnegative:

$$
x \ge 0
$$

- nonpositive:

$$
x \le 0
$$

- free / unrestricted in sign:

$$
x \in \mathbb{R}
$$

- bounded:

$$
a \le x \le b
$$

So there is nothing universal that says every variable must satisfy $x \ge 0$.

## 3. Why you often see $x \ge 0$ in LPs

That is because many textbooks write LPs in **standard form**, where variables are taken to be nonnegative.

But that is just a convenient canonical form.

If a variable is unrestricted, you can always rewrite it as

$$
x = x^+ - x^-,
\qquad
x^+,x^- \ge 0.
$$

So even free variables can be converted into standard-form nonnegative variables if needed.

## 4. In this homework problem

For `HW3 Problem 4`:

- the error variables $e_i$ **must** satisfy

$$
e_i \ge 0
$$

because they represent absolute-value magnitudes

- the approximation values $g_i$ do **not** need an explicit sign restriction

They can be positive or negative depending on the data.

So in your LP:
- $e_i$ are constrained nonnegative
- $g_i$ are free variables unless you decide to convert everything to standard form

## The short answer

No. Not every LP variable has to be nonnegative.

Nonnegativity is common in standard form, but in actual modeling some variables are free, some are bounded, and some are tied together by equality constraints.

For this problem specifically:
- $e_i \ge 0$
- $g_i$ free

### Q3
Do you want me to show how the dual changes when a primal variable is free versus when it is constrained to be nonnegative?

---
### Turn 7
User asked:
> Wait, so did we basically answer the first part of the question?

Assistant response:
Yes. We basically have part `(a)`.

What part `(a)` asked for was:
- decision variables
- objective
- linear constraints that encode absolute error
- linear constraints that encode convexity

And we now have all of that:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{g_0,\dots,g_{N-1},\,e_0,\dots,e_{N-1}}
\quad & \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} e_i \\
\text{s.t.}\quad
& g_i-f(i)\le e_i, \qquad i=0,\dots,N-1, \\
& f(i)-g_i\le e_i, \qquad i=0,\dots,N-1, \\
& g_{i+1}-2g_i+g_{i-1}\ge 0, \qquad i=1,\dots,N-2, \\
& e_i\ge 0, \qquad i=0,\dots,N-1.
\end{aligned}
$$

So yes, conceptually and mathematically, that answers part `(a)`.

The only thing left would be polish:
- make sure you state that $g_i$ are free variables
- optionally mention that the convexity constraint is equivalent to nondecreasing slopes
- present it in clean notation

But the modeling content itself is done.

What remains now is part `(b)`: the dual and its interpretation.

---
### Turn 8
User asked:
> Okay, how do we do the dual? If I remember that like, so we have, um, there's a few things like every constraint becomes like a variable and then every variable becomes a constraint, right? And like, do we have to like form the Lagrangian of this?

Assistant response:
Yes, that memory is basically right:

- primal constraints give rise to dual variables
- primal variables end up generating dual constraints

And yes, for **this** problem, forming the Lagrangian is the cleanest way.

Why?

Because our primal has:
- two families of `<=` constraints,
- one family of convexity constraints,
- nonnegative variables $e_i$,
- and free variables $g_i$.

That mix is exactly where the "just memorize the transpose rule" approach gets messy.

## The right plan

Take the primal:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{g,e}\quad & \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} e_i \\
\text{s.t.}\quad
& g_i-f(i)-e_i \le 0, \\
& f(i)-g_i-e_i \le 0, \\
& 2g_i-g_{i+1}-g_{i-1}\le 0 \qquad (i=1,\dots,N-2), \\
& e_i \ge 0.
\end{aligned}
$$

and attach dual variables:

- $u_i \ge 0$ for

$$
g_i-f(i)-e_i \le 0
$$

- $v_i \ge 0$ for

$$
f(i)-g_i-e_i \le 0
$$

- $w_i \ge 0$ for

$$
2g_i-g_{i+1}-g_{i-1}\le 0,
\qquad i=1,\dots,N-2
$$

Then build the Lagrangian.

## Why this helps

When you minimize the Lagrangian over the primal variables:

- the coefficients of the free variables $g_i$ must cancel exactly
  - that gives equality-type dual constraints

- the coefficients of the nonnegative variables $e_i$ must satisfy a sign condition
  - that gives inequality-type dual constraints

That is the structural reason dual constraints appear.

So yes:
- use the Lagrangian
- assign one multiplier to each primal constraint
- then minimize over $g$ and $e$

That is the clean route.

### Q4
Do you want to derive the actual Lagrangian together now?

---
### Turn 9
User asked:
> Yes, please. Can you help me walk through it?

Assistant response:
Yes. Let us do it cleanly.

First, to reduce clutter, write

$$
f_i := f(i).
$$

Then the primal is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{g,e}\quad & \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} e_i \\
\text{s.t.}\quad
& g_i-f_i-e_i \le 0, \qquad i=0,\dots,N-1, \\
& f_i-g_i-e_i \le 0, \qquad i=0,\dots,N-1, \\
& 2g_i-g_{i+1}-g_{i-1} \le 0, \qquad i=1,\dots,N-2, \\
& e_i \ge 0, \qquad i=0,\dots,N-1,
\end{aligned}
$$

with $g_i$ free.

We will keep $e_i\ge 0$ as part of the variable domain rather than attaching another multiplier to it. That is the cleanest route.

## Step 1: attach dual variables

Introduce:

- $u_i \ge 0$ for

$$
g_i-f_i-e_i \le 0
$$

- $v_i \ge 0$ for

$$
f_i-g_i-e_i \le 0
$$

- $w_i \ge 0$ for

$$
2g_i-g_{i+1}-g_{i-1}\le 0,
\qquad i=1,\dots,N-2
$$

## Step 2: write the Lagrangian

The Lagrangian is

$$
\begin{aligned}
L(g,e,u,v,w)
=\;& \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} e_i \\
&+ \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} u_i(g_i-f_i-e_i) \\
&+ \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} v_i(f_i-g_i-e_i) \\
&+ \sum_{i=1}^{N-2} w_i(2g_i-g_{i+1}-g_{i-1}).
\end{aligned}
$$

That is the correct starting point.

## Step 3: group terms by type

First group the easy constant terms involving the known data $f_i$:

$$
\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} (v_i-u_i)f_i.
$$

Next, group the $e_i$ terms:

$$
\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} (1-u_i-v_i)e_i.
$$

Now the important part: group the $g_i$ terms.

From the first two constraint families, $g_i$ gets coefficient

$$
u_i-v_i.
$$

From the convexity terms, each $g_i$ also appears in nearby second-difference constraints.

So the total coefficient of $g_i$ becomes:

- for $i=0$:

$$
u_0-v_0-w_1
$$

- for $i=N-1$:

$$
u_{N-1}-v_{N-1}-w_{N-2}
$$

- for $i=1,\dots,N-2$:

$$
u_i-v_i + 2w_i - w_{i-1} - w_{i+1}
$$

So after grouping, the Lagrangian has the form

$$
\begin{aligned}
L
=\;& \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} (v_i-u_i)f_i
 + \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} (1-u_i-v_i)e_i \\
&+ (u_0-v_0-w_1)g_0 \\
&+ \sum_{i=1}^{N-2} (u_i-v_i+2w_i-w_{i-1}-w_{i+1})g_i \\
&+ (u_{N-1}-v_{N-1}-w_{N-2})g_{N-1}.
\end{aligned}
$$

## Step 4: minimize over the primal variables

The dual function is

$$
q(u,v,w)=\inf_{g\in\mathbb{R}^N,\; e\ge 0} L(g,e,u,v,w).
$$

Now use the variable types:

### Because each $g_i$ is free

If a free variable has a nonzero coefficient, the infimum is $-\infty$.

So we must have:

$$
u_0-v_0-w_1 = 0,
$$

$$
u_i-v_i+2w_i-w_{i-1}-w_{i+1}=0
\qquad i=1,\dots,N-2,
$$

$$
u_{N-1}-v_{N-1}-w_{N-2}=0.
$$

These are the dual constraints coming from the $g_i$ variables.

### Because each $e_i \ge 0$

The term

$$
(1-u_i-v_i)e_i
$$

has finite infimum over $e_i\ge 0$ only if

$$
1-u_i-v_i \ge 0,
$$

that is,

$$
u_i+v_i \le 1.
$$

Otherwise the infimum would be $-\infty$.

So these are the dual constraints coming from the $e_i$ variables.

## Step 5: read off the dual objective

Once the coefficients of the primal variables are handled, the only surviving term is

$$
\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} (v_i-u_i)f_i.
$$

So the dual is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\max_{u,v,w}\quad & \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} (v_i-u_i)f_i \\
\text{s.t.}\quad
& u_0-v_0-w_1 = 0, \\
& u_i-v_i+2w_i-w_{i-1}-w_{i+1}=0,
\qquad i=1,\dots,N-2, \\
& u_{N-1}-v_{N-1}-w_{N-2}=0, \\
& u_i+v_i \le 1,
\qquad i=0,\dots,N-1, \\
& u_i,v_i \ge 0,
\qquad i=0,\dots,N-1, \\
& w_i \ge 0,
\qquad i=1,\dots,N-2.
\end{aligned}
$$

That is the dual in a clean form.

### Q5
Before interpretation, tell me in one sentence:

Why did the free variables $g_i$ produce equality constraints in the dual?

---
### Turn 10
User asked:
> Because the g variables can be like positive or negative. So like, if, if the, if we didn't have an equality constraint for the coefficient that multiplies those g values, and it was like, any number, like that's not zero, then you can basically make gi really big or really small and then achieve, like negative infinity for the infimum. So the coefficient on the gi term has to be set to zero in order for there to be a valid infimum. Right. I didn't understand why we arrive at a one surviving term. Can you explain that a little bit? Are we just trying to get rid of the other terms in L? Oh, I guess that's what we're minimizing. Or maximizing. Wait, but why are we maximizing it in the dual if the dual is trying to find the infimum? Because N-P-M is like negative, right?

Assistant response:
Yes, your first sentence is exactly right.

Now for the bigger confusion: there are **two different optimizations** happening.

## 1. First: define the dual function by taking an infimum

For fixed dual variables $(u,v,w)$, define

$$
q(u,v,w)=\inf_{g\in\mathbb{R}^N,\; e\ge 0} L(g,e,u,v,w).
$$

So at this stage:
- $u,v,w$ are held fixed
- we minimize over the primal variables $g,e$

That is where the infimum comes from.

## 2. Second: optimize over the dual variables

Once you have the function $q(u,v,w)$, the **dual problem** is

$$
\max_{u,v,w} q(u,v,w)
$$

subject to the dual feasibility conditions.

So:
- dual **function** = built using an infimum
- dual **problem** = maximize that function

That is why both words appear.

## Why maximize it?

Because for a primal **minimization** problem, the dual function gives a **lower bound** on the primal optimum.

Here is the key fact:

If $g,e$ are primal feasible, then every constraint term in the Lagrangian is $\le 0$, and the multipliers are nonnegative, so

$$
L(g,e,u,v,w)\le \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} e_i.
$$

Therefore

$$
q(u,v,w)=\inf_{g,e} L(g,e,u,v,w)
\le
\text{primal optimum}.
$$

So each dual-feasible choice of $(u,v,w)$ gives a lower bound on the primal minimum.

The best thing to do is maximize that lower bound.

That is exactly what the dual problem does.

## Why does only one term survive?

Because after grouping, the Lagrangian looked like

$$
L = \text{constant term in }(u,v,w)
+ \sum_i (\text{coeff of }e_i)e_i
+ \sum_i (\text{coeff of }g_i)g_i.
$$

Now minimize over $g,e$.

### Free $g_i$ terms

If a coefficient of $g_i$ is not zero, the infimum is $-\infty$.

So to get a finite dual function, those coefficients must be zero.

That makes all the $g_i$ terms disappear.

### Nonnegative $e_i$ terms

For each term

$$
(1-u_i-v_i)e_i, \qquad e_i\ge 0,
$$

if

$$
1-u_i-v_i < 0,
$$

then we can send $e_i\to\infty$ and get $-\infty$.

So for finiteness we need

$$
1-u_i-v_i \ge 0.
$$

Once that holds, the smallest value over $e_i\ge 0$ is achieved at

$$
e_i=0,
$$

and contributes

$$
0.
$$

So the $e_i$ terms also disappear **after minimization**.

That leaves only the part that does not depend on $g$ or $e$, namely

$$
\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} (v_i-u_i)f_i.
$$

That is why there is one surviving term: it is the constant part of the Lagrangian after minimizing out the primal variables.

## Tiny summary

- inf over primal variables gives the dual function
- max over dual variables gives the dual problem
- $g_i$ terms vanish because free-variable coefficients must be zero
- $e_i$ terms vanish because their minimum over $e_i\ge 0$ is $0$ when the sign condition holds
- the constant term becomes the dual objective

If you want, next I can explain the **interpretation** of $u_i, v_i, w_i$ in plain English, which is the part the homework is probably really after in `(b)`.

### Turn 11
User asked:
> yeah, sure, give me that.

Assistant response:
Yes. This is the plain-English interpretation.

## 1. What $u_i$ and $v_i$ mean

These come from the two constraints that linearize

$$
|g_i-f_i|.
$$

Namely:

$$
g_i-f_i \le e_i
$$

and

$$
f_i-g_i \le e_i.
$$

So:

- $u_i$ is the dual variable for the constraint

$$
g_i-f_i \le e_i,
$$

which is the side that matters when $g_i$ sits **above** the data value $f_i$.

- $v_i$ is the dual variable for the constraint

$$
f_i-g_i \le e_i,
$$

which is the side that matters when $g_i$ sits **below** the data value $f_i$.

So in words:

- $u_i$ measures pressure from fitting the data from the "above-data" side
- $v_i$ measures pressure from fitting the data from the "below-data" side

If one of those constraints is slack, its multiplier should be zero at optimum.
If it is active, its multiplier may be positive.

So they tell you which side of the absolute-value deviation is actually binding at sample $i$.

## 2. What $w_i$ means

These come from the convexity constraints

$$
2g_i-g_{i+1}-g_{i-1}\le 0
\qquad (i=1,\dots,N-2).
$$

Equivalently,

$$
g_{i+1}-2g_i+g_{i-1}\ge 0.
$$

So $w_i$ is the dual variable that measures how much the convexity constraint at location $i$ matters.

Plain English:

- if $w_i=0$, the convexity constraint at that location is not "pushing" on the solution
- if $w_i>0$, that convexity constraint is active / binding

Geometrically, when $w_i>0$, you should expect

$$
g_{i+1}-2g_i+g_{i-1}=0,
$$

which means the local slope change is exactly at the convexity boundary there.

That usually means the fitted curve is locally as straight as it can be at that triple of points.

## 3. What the equality constraints in the dual mean

The dual equalities came from the free variables $g_i$:

$$
u_i-v_i + \text{(neighboring }w\text{ terms)} = 0.
$$

Interpretation:

At each sample point, the "fit pressure" from the data terms must balance the "shape pressure" coming from nearby convexity constraints.

So the dual is expressing an equilibrium:

- $u_i,v_i$ want the fit to match the observed data
- $w_i$ enforce that the whole sequence still looks convex

The optimal fit is where those two forces balance.

## 4. What $u_i+v_i\le 1$ means

This comes from minimizing over the error variables $e_i$.

Interpretation:

The total dual pressure from the two one-sided error constraints cannot exceed the unit cost of paying one unit of fitting error in the primal objective.

So this inequality is the dual shadow of the fact that the primal objective charges

$$
1 \cdot e_i
$$

for each point.

## Short homework-style interpretation

A good concise writeup for part `(b)` is:

> The dual variables $u_i$ and $v_i$ correspond to the two inequalities used to linearize the absolute error at sample $i$, so they measure whether the approximation is being pushed from above or below the data value $f(i)$. The variables $w_i$ correspond to the discrete convexity constraints and therefore measure where convexity is active in the fitted curve. In particular, if $w_i>0$, then the convexity constraint at index $i$ is binding, meaning the local second difference is zero and the fitted curve is locally at the boundary of convexity. The dual equality constraints express balance between data-fitting pressure ($u_i,v_i$) and shape-enforcing pressure ($w_i$).

That is the interpretation the homework is really looking for.
