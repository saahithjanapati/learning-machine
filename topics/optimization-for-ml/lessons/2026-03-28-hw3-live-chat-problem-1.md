### Turn 1
User asked:
> let's go through problem 1 interactively

Assistant response:
We are focusing only on `HW3 Problem 1: Proximal Algorithms`.

Session plan:
1. Rebuild the objects: prox operator, composite objective, gradient mapping.
2. Identify the proof skeleton for part `1.1`.
3. Separate what comes from smoothness, what comes from prox optimality, and what comes from strong convexity.
4. Connect the descent lemma to the linear-rate result in `1.2`.

Current recommended mode:
- explanation first,
- then short-answer checkpoints,
- then proof assembly.

### Q1
Before any algebra, tell me in your own words:

What is the optimization structure in Problem 1?

More specifically:
1. What is smooth?
2. What is possibly nonsmooth?
3. Why are we using a proximal step instead of plain gradient descent on the whole objective?

---
### Turn 2
User asked:
> Yeah, let's invoke this scale specifically and then let's do the live chat here.

Assistant response:
Using `markdown-live-chat` together with `adaptive-session-tutor` for this session.

What that means now:
- we continue the live chat here in the terminal,
- the actual conversation content should also be mirrored into this markdown file,
- we stay in one-question-at-a-time mode for `HW3 Problem 1`.

We will start with the first conceptual checkpoint before doing any derivation.

### Q1
In Problem 1, the objective has the form

$$
f(x) = g(x) + h(x).
$$

Tell me, in your own words:

1. What do we know about `g`?
2. What do we know about `h`?
3. Why is plain gradient descent on all of `f` not the natural method here?

---
### Turn 3
User asked:
> Well, instead of doing questions, like let's go through, um, like give me a brief rundown of all the topics that I need to know first for question one specifically.

Assistant response:
Yes. Switching to explanation-first for `HW3 Problem 1`.

Here is the brief rundown of what you need for Question 1 specifically.

## Problem 1 topic stack

### 1. Composite optimization structure

The whole setup is

$$
f(x) = g(x) + h(x),
$$

where:
- $g$ is smooth and strongly convex
- $h$ is convex but may be nonsmooth

This is the reason proximal gradient exists in the first place. We do not want to treat $f$ as a generic smooth function, because $h$ may not be differentiable.

### 2. Proximal operator

You need the definition

$$
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(v) = \arg\min_z \left( \frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-v\|_2^2 + h(z) \right).
$$

Conceptually:
- the quadratic term keeps you near $v$
- the $h(z)$ term handles the nonsmooth structure directly

### 3. Proximal-gradient update

The update is

$$
x^+ = \operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x - \eta \nabla g(x)).
$$

So:
- take a gradient step on the smooth part $g$
- then apply the prox for the nonsmooth part $h$

That is the central algorithmic idea behind the whole question.

### 4. Gradient mapping

This is the prox analogue of the usual gradient:

$$
G_\eta(x) = \frac{1}{\eta}\left(x - \operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x - \eta \nabla g(x))\right).
$$

So the update can be rewritten as

$$
x^+ = x - \eta G_\eta(x).
$$

This matters because the homework's descent lemma is written in terms of $G_\eta(x)$, not $\nabla f(x)$.

### 5. Smoothness inequality for $g$

For $\beta$-smooth $g$, you should know:

$$
g(y) \le g(x) + \nabla g(x)^\top (y-x) + \frac{\beta}{2}\|y-x\|_2^2.
$$

For part `(a)`, this is basically the whole move.

You plug in

$$
y = x - \eta G_\eta(x)
$$

and simplify.

### 6. Strong convexity inequality for $g$

For $\alpha$-strongly convex $g$, you should know:

$$
g(z) \ge g(x) + \nabla g(x)^\top (z-x) + \frac{\alpha}{2}\|z-x\|_2^2.
$$

This is what upgrades the usual proximal descent lemma into the stronger version with the extra negative curvature term

$$
-\frac{\alpha}{2}\|x-z\|_2^2.
$$

This is the key new ingredient in Problem 1 compared with the plain convex prox-GD story.

### 7. Convexity / subgradient inequality for $h$

Because $h$ may be nonsmooth, you do not differentiate it.

Instead, you use:
- convexity of $h$
- the optimality condition of the prox step

The prox optimality condition gives a subgradient of $h$ at the prox point. That is what drives part `(b)`.

This is the main structural trick of the problem.

### 8. Prox optimality condition

If

$$
u = \operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x - \eta \nabla g(x)),
$$

then

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}\big((x - \eta \nabla g(x)) - u\big) \in \partial h(u).
$$

Since in this problem

$$
u = x - \eta G_\eta(x),
$$

that becomes

$$
G_\eta(x) - \nabla g(x) \in \partial h(x - \eta G_\eta(x)).
$$

That exact expression is the bridge you need in part `(b)`.

### 9. The proof structure of 1.1

Problem `1.1` is really:

1. Use smoothness on $g$.
2. Use prox optimality plus convexity on $h$.
3. Add the two inequalities.
4. Use strong convexity to bring in the $-\frac{\alpha}{2}\|x-z\|^2$ term.

So each subpart is testing a different ingredient:
- `(a)` smoothness
- `(b)` prox/subgradient argument
- `(c)` combine everything cleanly

### 10. Step-size condition

You also need to keep track of

$$
\eta \le \frac{1}{\beta}.
$$

That is what makes the smoothness term behave correctly when you simplify the coefficient of $\|G_\eta(x)\|^2$.

So do not treat that assumption as cosmetic. It is used in the inequality cleanup.

### 11. Linear convergence part

For `1.2`, the main topic is:
- how a descent lemma turns into a contraction / linear rate when strong convexity is available

You should expect:
- plug in $z = x^*$
- use that $x^*$ is the optimizer
- derive a recursive shrinkage inequality
- relate the rate to the condition number

$$
\kappa = \frac{\beta}{\alpha}.
$$

The final factor

$$
1 - \frac{1}{\kappa}
$$

is the strong-convexity version of "we get geometric improvement each step."

## Short version

If you want the shortest possible list, know these 6 things first:

1. what composite optimization means
2. what the prox operator is
3. what the gradient mapping $G_\eta(x)$ is
4. the smoothness inequality for $g$
5. the strong convexity inequality for $g$
6. the prox optimality condition and how it gives a subgradient of $h$ at the prox point

If those are solid, Problem 1 becomes a proof-assembly exercise instead of a mystery.

If you want, next I can do one of these two things:

1. give a clean intuitive explanation of part `(b)` specifically, since that is usually the least obvious part
2. walk through the full proof skeleton of `1.1` without doing the algebra line-by-line yet

### Turn 4
User asked:
> Can you also add in the skill for the interactive live chats to use color coding for equations when like terms are like the same or shared between different equations so that it's easier for the learner?

Assistant response:
Yes. I updated the `markdown-live-chat` skill so interactive live chats can explicitly use equation color coding when the same term is being tracked across multiple equations.

What changed in the skill:
- it now says to use consistent color coding for repeated/shared terms across derivation steps when that helps clarity
- it requires a small stable palette instead of random colors
- it says to include a short legend the first time a colored derivation is introduced
- it keeps the existing dark-mode accessibility rule, so colors should stay bright and readable in Obsidian

Default palette added to the skill:
- current/base term: bright cyan `#67E8F9`
- first-order / gradient / descent term: bright rose `#FDA4AF`
- constraint / projection / curvature correction: bright mint `#86EFAC`
- step size / scalar coefficient / convergence factor: bright violet `#C4B5FD`
- stochastic / sampled / noisy term: bright gold `#FDE047`

Operational rule:
- if the same term appears across adjacent equations, keep it in the same color
- if colors would add clutter, prefer plain math instead

So for future live-chat derivations, we can do things like keep:
- the same $G_\eta(x)$ term in one color,
- the step-size $\eta$ in another,
- and the curvature/prox correction terms in a third,

so it is visually obvious what carries through each line.

---
### Turn 5
User asked:
> wait can you help me through part b a lil bit? what is the prox point?

Assistant response:
Yes. For part `(b)`, the **prox point** is just the point you get **after applying the proximal operator**.

In Problem 1, start from the usual proximal-gradient step:

$$
x^+ = \operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x - \eta \nabla g(x)).
$$

That new point $x^+$ is the prox point.

The homework then rewrites the same point using the gradient mapping:

$$
G_\eta(x)=\frac{1}{\eta}\left(x-\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x-\eta \nabla g(x))\right).
$$

Rearranging gives

$$
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x-\eta \nabla g(x)) = x-\eta G_\eta(x).
$$

So in this problem, the prox point is

$$
x-\eta G_\eta(x).
$$

Those two expressions are the same point:

$$
x^+ = \operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x-\eta \nabla g(x)) = x-\eta G_\eta(x).
$$

## Intuition

Think of it in two stages:

1. First form the gradient-step proposal

$$
\tilde{x} = x-\eta \nabla g(x).
$$

2. Then apply the prox for $h$:

$$
x^+ = \operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(\tilde{x}).
$$

So:
- $\tilde{x}$ is the raw gradient-step point
- $x^+$ is the prox point after correcting for the nonsmooth part $h$

That distinction matters a lot in part `(b)`.

## Why part `(b)` cares about the prox point

Because the prox optimality condition gives you a subgradient of $h$ **at the prox point**, not at the original point $x$.

If

$$
u = \operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x-\eta \nabla g(x)),
$$

then

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}\big((x-\eta \nabla g(x)) - u\big)\in \partial h(u).
$$

Now plug in

$$
u = x-\eta G_\eta(x).
$$

Then

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}\big((x-\eta \nabla g(x))-(x-\eta G_\eta(x))\big)
= G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)
\in \partial h(x-\eta G_\eta(x)).
$$

That is the exact reason the prox point shows up in part `(b)`.

## Short version

The prox point is:

$$
x^+ = \operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x-\eta \nabla g(x))
$$

and in this homework that same point is written as

$$
x-\eta G_\eta(x).
$$

So whenever part `(b)` talks about using convexity "at the prox point," it means using convexity of $h$ at

$$
x-\eta G_\eta(x).
$$

If you want, next I can do the very next step only:

how convexity of $h$ at the prox point turns into the displayed inequality in part `(b)`.

---
### Turn 6
User asked:
> But like the expression that we want to show is like h of x minus n gn like I Feel like right now the proc point is just x minus n G n right like how do you get the h? from there i'm getting confused, like how are we mixing G and H here?

Assistant response:
Yes, this is exactly the right place to pause. The key point is:

We are **not** getting $h$ from $G$.

We are doing this instead:
- evaluate $h$ **at the prox point**
- use a **subgradient of $h$ at that point**
- that subgradient happens to be expressible using $G_\eta(x)$

So the mix happens through the **prox optimality condition**.

## The clean setup

Let

$$
u \;=\; \operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x-\eta \nabla g(x)).
$$

This point $u$ is the prox point.

Because of the gradient mapping definition, this same point is

$$
u \;=\; x-\eta G_\eta(x).
$$

So yes:

$$
h(x-\eta G_\eta(x)) = h(u).
$$

There is no trick there. We are just renaming the prox point by $u$.

## Where $G_\eta(x)$ enters

Since $u$ is defined by a prox minimization problem, first-order optimality of the prox problem gives

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}\big((x-\eta \nabla g(x)) - u\big)\in \partial h(u).
$$

Now substitute

$$
u = x-\eta G_\eta(x).
$$

Then

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}\big((x-\eta \nabla g(x))-(x-\eta G_\eta(x))\big)
= G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x).
$$

So we get

$$
G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\in \partial h(u).
$$

Since $u=x-\eta G_\eta(x)$, this is

$$
G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\in \partial h(x-\eta G_\eta(x)).
$$

This is the bridge.

So:
- $h$ is still just the function $h$
- the prox step gives you a subgradient of $h$
- that subgradient is written in terms of $G_\eta(x)$

## Why that helps

For a convex function, if $s \in \partial h(u)$, then

$$
h(z)\ge h(u)+s^\top(z-u).
$$

Rearrange:

$$
h(u)\le h(z)+s^\top(u-z).
$$

Now plug in

$$
u = x-\eta G_\eta(x),
\qquad
s = G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x).
$$

That gives

$$
h(x-\eta G_\eta(x))
\le
h(z)

+ \big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top\big(x-\eta G_\eta(x)-z\big).
$$

That is the first real line of part `(b)`.

## Then the rest is just expansion

Expand the inner product:

$$
\big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top\big(x-z-\eta G_\eta(x)\big)
$$

$$
=
\big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top(x-z)
-\eta \big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top G_\eta(x)
$$

$$
=
-\big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top(z-x)
-\eta \|G_\eta(x)\|^2
+\eta \nabla g(x)^\top G_\eta(x).
$$

And that is exactly why the final inequality contains:
- an $h(z)$ term,
- a $-\eta\|G_\eta(x)\|^2$ term,
- an $\eta \nabla g(x)^\top G_\eta(x)$ term,
- and a $-(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x))^\top(z-x)$ term.

## Short version

You are not turning $G$ into $h$.

You are doing:

1. define the prox point
$$
u=x-\eta G_\eta(x)
$$

2. get a subgradient of $h$ at that point
$$
G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\in \partial h(u)
$$

3. apply the convexity inequality for $h$
$$
h(u)\le h(z)+s^\top(u-z)
$$

That is the whole mechanism of part `(b)`.

If you want, next I can rewrite part `(b)` in a very explicit `line 1 -> line 2 -> line 3` format with color-coded repeated terms so you can visually track exactly what is being substituted and expanded.

---
### Turn 7
User asked:
> Yes, please, that would be good. Like, please go step by step slowly.

Assistant response:
Yes. Let us do part `(b)` very slowly.

I am going to freeze the repeated pieces with colors:

- <span style="color:#67E8F9">cyan</span>: the prox point
- <span style="color:#FDA4AF">rose</span>: the subgradient term from prox optimality
- <span style="color:#C4B5FD">violet</span>: the step-size factor $\eta$

For readability, let me shorten notation first:

$$
G \;:=\; G_\eta(x),
\qquad
\nabla g \;:=\; \nabla g(x).
$$

So the prox point is

$$
{\color{#67E8F9}{u}}
\;:=\;
x - {\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}\,G.
$$

## Step 1: identify the prox point

From the definition of the gradient mapping,

$$
G_\eta(x)
=
\frac{1}{{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}}
\left(
x - \operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x-{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}\nabla g(x))
\right).
$$

Rearranging gives

$$
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x-{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}\nabla g(x))
=
x-{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}G
=
{\color{#67E8F9}{u}}.
$$

So

$$
h(x-{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}G)=h({\color{#67E8F9}{u}}).
$$

That is why the left side of part `(b)` has $h(x-\eta G_\eta(x))$.

## Step 2: use the prox optimality condition

Because

$$
{\color{#67E8F9}{u}}
=
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x-{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}\nabla g),
$$

the prox optimality condition says

$$
\frac{1}{{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}}
\left(
(x-{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}\nabla g)-{\color{#67E8F9}{u}}
\right)
\in
\partial h({\color{#67E8F9}{u}}).
$$

Now substitute

$$
{\color{#67E8F9}{u}}=x-{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}G.
$$

Then

$$
\frac{1}{{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}}
\left(
(x-{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}\nabla g)
-
(x-{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}G)
\right)
\in
\partial h({\color{#67E8F9}{u}}).
$$

Simplify the inside:

$$
\frac{1}{{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}}
\left(
-{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}\nabla g
+{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}G
\right)
\in
\partial h({\color{#67E8F9}{u}}).
$$

So

$$
{\color{#FDA4AF}{(G-\nabla g)}}
\in
\partial h({\color{#67E8F9}{u}}).
$$

This is the exact place where the $G-\nabla g$ term comes from.

## Step 3: apply the convexity inequality for $h$

For any convex function $h$, if $s\in\partial h(u)$, then

$$
h(z)\ge h(u)+s^\top(z-u).
$$

Rearrange this into the form we want:

$$
h(u)\le h(z)+s^\top(u-z).
$$

Now plug in

$$
{\color{#67E8F9}{u}} = x-{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}G,
\qquad
{\color{#FDA4AF}{s}} = {\color{#FDA4AF}{(G-\nabla g)}}.
$$

Then

$$
h({\color{#67E8F9}{u}})
\le
h(z)
+
{\color{#FDA4AF}{(G-\nabla g)}}^\top
\big({\color{#67E8F9}{u}}-z\big).
$$

Now replace ${\color{#67E8F9}{u}}$ by $x-{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}G$:

$$
h(x-{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}G)
\le
h(z)
+
{\color{#FDA4AF}{(G-\nabla g)}}^\top
\big(x-{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}G-z\big).
$$

This is the main inequality. Everything after this is algebra expansion.

## Step 4: expand the last inner product

First split the vector inside:

$$
x-{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}G-z
=
(x-z)-{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}G.
$$

So

$$
h(x-{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}G)
\le
h(z)
+
{\color{#FDA4AF}{(G-\nabla g)}}^\top(x-z)
-
{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}\,
{\color{#FDA4AF}{(G-\nabla g)}}^\top G.
$$

Now expand the second inner product:

$$
{\color{#FDA4AF}{(G-\nabla g)}}^\top G
=
G^\top G - \nabla g^\top G
=
\|G\|^2 - \nabla g^\top G.
$$

Substitute that back in:

$$
h(x-{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}G)
\le
h(z)
+
{\color{#FDA4AF}{(G-\nabla g)}}^\top(x-z)
-
{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}\big(\|G\|^2-\nabla g^\top G\big).
$$

Distribute the $-\eta$:

$$
h(x-{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}G)
\le
h(z)
+
{\color{#FDA4AF}{(G-\nabla g)}}^\top(x-z)
-
{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}\|G\|^2
+
{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}\,\nabla g^\top G.
$$

Now rewrite the first inner-product term the way the homework wants:

$$
{\color{#FDA4AF}{(G-\nabla g)}}^\top(x-z)
=
-\,{\color{#FDA4AF}{(G-\nabla g)}}^\top(z-x).
$$

So finally:

$$
h(x-{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}G)
\le
h(z)
-
{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}\|G\|^2
+
{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}\,\nabla g^\top G
-
{\color{#FDA4AF}{(G-\nabla g)}}^\top(z-x).
$$

Now put back the full notation $G=G_\eta(x)$ and $\nabla g=\nabla g(x)$:

$$
h(x-\eta G_\eta(x))
\le
h(z)
- \eta \|G_\eta(x)\|_2^2
+ \eta \nabla g(x)^\top G_\eta(x)
- (G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x))^\top (z-x).
$$

That is exactly part `(b)`.

## What to remember

The logic is:

1. define the prox point
$$
u=x-\eta G_\eta(x)
$$

2. prox optimality gives a subgradient of $h$ at that point
$$
G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\in\partial h(u)
$$

3. convexity of $h$ turns that into an upper bound on $h(u)$

4. then expand

## One sentence summary

Part `(b)` is just:

prox point $\to$ prox subgradient of $h$ $\to$ convexity inequality for $h$ $\to$ algebra.

### Turn 8
User asked:
> Okay, make a note that you shouldn't color code individual variables. Or like, there's no point in color coding the eta variable. Like, you should color code groups of things that transform throughout the whole set of equations, if that makes sense.

Assistant response:
Yes. That is a better rule.

I updated the `markdown-live-chat` skill so color coding should focus on **term groups that persist and transform across lines**, not isolated repeated variables.

What is now explicitly discouraged:
- coloring standalone variables just because they repeat
- coloring $\eta$ by itself when it is not the real object being tracked

What is now preferred:
- color whole expression blocks such as
  - $x-\eta G_\eta(x)$
  - $G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)$
  - $\eta\|G_\eta(x)\|^2$
  - $(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x))^\top(z-x)$

So the rule going forward is:
- color the mathematical chunk that survives and changes across equations
- not the individual symbol inside it

That is the version I will use from here on.

### Turn 9
User asked:
> where did this come from?
>
> $$

> \left(
> (x-{\color{#C4B5FD}{\eta}}\nabla g)-{\color{#67E8F9}{u}}

> \in
> $$

Assistant response:
It comes from the **optimality condition of the proximal minimization problem**.

Start from the definition of the prox point:

$$
u=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x-\eta \nabla g(x)).
$$

By definition, that means $u$ minimizes

$$
\phi(z)
=
\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))\|^2 + h(z).
$$

So the question becomes:

What condition must hold at the minimizer of $\phi(z)$?

For a convex minimization problem, the first-order optimality condition is

$$
0\in \partial \phi(u).
$$

Now split the subgradient of $\phi$ into its two parts:

1. the quadratic term
2. the $h(z)$ term

The quadratic term is smooth, so its gradient is

$$
\nabla \left(\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))\|^2\right)
=
\frac{1}{\eta}\big(z-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))\big).
$$

Evaluate that at $z=u$:

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}\big(u-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))\big).
$$

So

$$
0
\in
\frac{1}{\eta}\big(u-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))\big)
+
\partial h(u).
$$

Now move the quadratic-gradient term to the other side:

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}\big((x-\eta \nabla g(x))-u\big)\in \partial h(u).
$$

That is exactly the line you asked about.

So the origin is:

1. write the prox definition as an explicit minimization problem
2. apply $0\in\partial(\text{objective})(u)$
3. differentiate the quadratic part
4. leave $h$ as a subgradient term
5. rearrange

That is all.

If you want, next I can show the same derivation with $v=x-\eta \nabla g(x)$ as a temporary variable so it looks cleaner:

$$
u=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(v)
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\frac{1}{\eta}(v-u)\in \partial h(u).
$$

### Turn 10
User asked:
> Wait, I don't understand. Like, where did we get the x minus n gradient g minus u? Like, where is that from?

Assistant response:
Yes. That term is just:

$$
\text{(the input to the prox)} - \text{(the output of the prox)}.
$$

That is all it is.

## Step 1: what is the input to the prox?

The prox point is defined by

$$
u=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x-\eta \nabla g(x)).
$$

So the thing you feed **into** the prox operator is

$$
v := x-\eta \nabla g(x).
$$

That is just the ordinary gradient-step proposal on the smooth part $g$.

So really the definition is

$$
u=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(v)
\qquad\text{with}\qquad
v=x-\eta \nabla g(x).
$$

## Step 2: what optimization problem does prox solve?

By definition,

$$
u=\arg\min_z \left(\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-v\|^2+h(z)\right).
$$

Now replace $v$ by $x-\eta \nabla g(x)$:

$$
u=\arg\min_z \left(\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))\|^2+h(z)\right).
$$

So inside that squared norm, the center point is

$$
x-\eta \nabla g(x).
$$

and the variable being optimized is $z$.

## Step 3: where does the subtraction come from?

When you differentiate the quadratic term

$$
\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-v\|^2,
$$

with respect to $z$, you get

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}(z-v).
$$

That is just the standard gradient of a squared distance:

$$
\nabla_z \frac12 \|z-v\|^2 = z-v.
$$

So here, since

$$
v=x-\eta \nabla g(x),
$$

the gradient of the quadratic part at $z=u$ is

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}\big(u-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))\big).
$$

That is where that expression comes from.

## Step 4: why does it sometimes appear with the opposite sign?

From optimality we get

$$
0 \in \frac{1}{\eta}\big(u-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))\big)+\partial h(u).
$$

Move the quadratic-gradient term to the other side:

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}\big((x-\eta \nabla g(x))-u\big)\in \partial h(u).
$$

So the expression

$$
(x-\eta \nabla g(x))-u
$$

is not appearing out of nowhere.

It is just the negative of

$$
u-(x-\eta \nabla g(x)),
$$

which came from differentiating the squared-distance term.

## Intuition

Think of:

$$
v=x-\eta \nabla g(x)
$$

as the raw proposal point.

Then the prox step moves you from $v$ to the final point $u$.

So

$$
v-u
$$

is literally the correction vector from the raw gradient step to the prox-corrected point.

After substituting back for $v$, that becomes

$$
(x-\eta \nabla g(x))-u.
$$

So the short answer is:

It comes from the quadratic term in the prox objective, and geometrically it is "proposal minus prox output."

If you want, next I can do a tiny 3-line derivation of

$$
\nabla_z \frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-v\|^2 = \frac{1}{\eta}(z-v)
$$

because that is the exact micro-step feeding this whole expression.

> Okay, so basically like x minus n gradient g is the point before you take the proc step or like you apply the proc's operation and u is like after the proc's operation. So basically going from after the proc's to before the proc's is like kind of like taking gradient step or like a sub gradient step of h and then so we're just saying that that vector is in the set of sub-gradients of H.

Assistant response:
Yes, that is very c Okay, wait, so can you like recontextualize what this is in the rest of the proof? 
lose.

Your core picture is correct:
- $x-\eta \nabla g(x)$ is the point **before** the prox step
- $u$ is the point **after** the prox step
- the difference between them is the prox correction

The one subtle fix is:

It is **not** exactly the raw vector

$$
(x-\eta \nabla g(x)) - u
$$

that is the subgradient.

It is the **scaled** vector

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}\Big((x-\eta \nabla g(x)) - u\Big)
$$

that lies in $\partial h(u)$.

So the precise statement is

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}\Big((x-\eta \nabla g(x)) - u\Big)\in \partial h(u).
$$

## Why the scaling by $1/\eta$?

Because the prox objective uses

$$
\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-v\|^2,
$$

so when you differentiate it, the factor $1/\eta$ comes out.

## Your intuition, stated cleanly

You can think of it like this:

1. take a gradient step on the smooth part $g$
$$
v=x-\eta \nabla g(x)
$$

2. the prox step adjusts that point to account for the nonsmooth part $h$
$$
u=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(v)
$$

3. the correction vector
$$
v-u
$$

tells you how much the nonsmooth term pushed back

4. after dividing by $\eta$, that correction behaves like a subgradient of $h$ at the new point $u$

So yes, your mental model is basically right:

the prox step is acting like "handle the $h$ part," and the correction from the raw gradient proposal to the prox output encodes subgradient information about $h$.

## One more tiny precision fix

It is a subgradient of $h$ **at the prox point $u$**, not at the original point $x$.

That matters a lot in part `(b)`.

---
### Turn 12
User asked:
> Okay, wait, so can you like recontextualize what this is in the rest of the proof?

Assistant response:
Yes. This is the right question.

The main point is:

This prox-optimality fact is **not the proof itself**.
It is just the tool that lets part `(b)` play the same role for $h$ that smoothness plays for $g$ in part `(a)`.

## The big structure of the proof

We want to bound

$$
f(x-\eta G_\eta(x))
=
g(x-\eta G_\eta(x))
+
h(x-\eta G_\eta(x)).
$$

So naturally the proof splits into two pieces:

1. control the $g$ term
2. control the $h$ term

That is exactly why the homework has parts `(a)` and `(b)`.

## What part `(a)` does

Part `(a)` handles

$$
g(x-\eta G_\eta(x)).
$$

---
### Turn 13
User asked:
> Okay, can you please try again?

Assistant response:
Yes. Let me restart this cleanly and only explain **where part `(b)` sits in the proof**.

## The target of the whole proof

Let

$$
y := x-\eta G_\eta(x).
$$

The whole proof is trying to upper-bound

$$
f(y)=g(y)+h(y).
$$

So there are only two jobs:

1. upper-bound $g(y)$
2. upper-bound $h(y)$

That is why the homework splits into `(a)` and `(b)`.

## What part `(a)` does

Part `(a)` gives an upper bound for

$$
g(y).
$$

It uses smoothness of $g$.

So part `(a)` is:

$$
\text{smoothness} \;\Rightarrow\; \text{bound on } g(y).
$$

## What part `(b)` does

Part `(b)` gives an upper bound for

$$
h(y).
$$

But $h$ may be nonsmooth, so we cannot use a gradient-smoothness argument.

Instead, we use the fact that $y$ is the **prox point**:

$$
y=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x-\eta \nabla g(x)).
$$

That gives a subgradient of $h$ at the point $y$:

$$
G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\in \partial h(y).
$$

Then convexity of $h$ gives an upper bound on $h(y)$.

So part `(b)` is:

$$
\text{prox optimality} \;\Rightarrow\; \text{subgradient of } h \text{ at } y
\;\Rightarrow\; \text{bound on } h(y).
$$

## Why this weird subgradient fact is needed

Because the proof needs to control

$$
h(y).
$$

The prox step is exactly what tells us how to do that.

Without prox optimality, the term $h(y)$ would just be sitting there with no clean way to bound it.

## What happens in part `(c)`

Now add the outputs of `(a)` and `(b)`:

- `(a)` gives a bound on $g(y)$
- `(b)` gives a bound on $h(y)$

So together they give a bound on

$$
g(y)+h(y)=f(y).
$$

That is the whole point.

## Why part `(b)` is written in that strange form

Because it is engineered to combine nicely with part `(a)`.

In particular, when you add the two inequalities, the terms involving

$$
\eta \nabla g(x)^\top G_\eta(x)
$$

cancel out.

That cancellation is intentional.

## Where strong convexity enters

After adding `(a)` and `(b)`, you still need the stronger final form.

That is where strong convexity of $g$ is used:

$$
g(x)\le g(z)+\nabla g(x)^\top(x-z)-\frac{\alpha}{2}\|x-z\|^2.
$$

That is what produces the extra negative term

$$
-\frac{\alpha}{2}\|x-z\|^2.
$$

## Clean one-line summary

Part `(a)` handles the smooth term $g(y)$.
Part `(b)` handles the nonsmooth term $h(y)$.
Part `(c)` adds them and then uses strong convexity to finish.

---
### Turn 14
User asked:
> Okay, go deeper on to the math regarding the part b again.

Assistant response:
Yes. Let us do the math of part `(b)` again, but in the cleanest notation possible.

## Goal of part `(b)`

We want to prove

$$
h(x-\eta G_\eta(x))
\le
h(z)
- \eta \|G_\eta(x)\|_2^2
+ \eta \nabla g(x)^\top G_\eta(x)
- (G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x))^\top (z-x).
$$

That looks messy, so let us rename two things.

Set

$$
v := x-\eta \nabla g(x)
$$

and

$$
y := \operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(v).
$$

Then by the definition of the gradient mapping,

$$
y = x-\eta G_\eta(x).
$$

So part `(b)` is really just a statement about bounding $h(y)$.

## Step 1: write down the optimization problem that defines $y$

Since $y=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(v)$, it is the minimizer of

$$
\phi(u)
=
\frac{1}{2\eta}\|u-v\|_2^2 + h(u).
$$

So

$$
y = \arg\min_u \phi(u).
$$

## Step 2: use first-order optimality of the prox problem

Because $\phi$ is convex and $y$ minimizes it,

$$
0 \in \partial \phi(y).
$$

Now compute the subgradient of $\phi$.

The quadratic part is differentiable, so

$$
\partial \phi(y)
=
\nabla\left(\frac{1}{2\eta}\|u-v\|_2^2\right)\Big|_{u=y}
+
\partial h(y).
$$

The gradient of the quadratic term is

$$
\nabla\left(\frac{1}{2\eta}\|u-v\|_2^2\right)
=
\frac{1}{\eta}(u-v).
$$

So at $u=y$,

$$
0 \in \frac{1}{\eta}(y-v) + \partial h(y).
$$

Rearrange:

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}(v-y)\in \partial h(y).
$$

This is the core prox-optimality fact.

## Step 3: rewrite that subgradient using $G_\eta(x)$

Now substitute back

$$
v=x-\eta \nabla g(x),
\qquad
y=x-\eta G_\eta(x).
$$

Then

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}(v-y)
=
\frac{1}{\eta}\Big((x-\eta \nabla g(x))-(x-\eta G_\eta(x))\Big).
$$

Simplify:

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}(v-y)
=
\frac{1}{\eta}\Big(\eta G_\eta(x)-\eta \nabla g(x)\Big)
=
G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x).
$$

So we have shown

$$
G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\in \partial h(y).
$$

## Step 4: apply the convexity inequality for $h$

If $s\in \partial h(y)$, then for every $z$,

$$
h(z)\ge h(y)+s^\top(z-y).
$$

Rearrange this:

$$
h(y)\le h(z)+s^\top(y-z).
$$

Now choose

$$
s = G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x).
$$

Then

$$
h(y)
\le
h(z)
+
\big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top (y-z).
$$

## Step 5: substitute the expression for $y$

Since

$$
y=x-\eta G_\eta(x),
$$

we get

$$
h(x-\eta G_\eta(x))
\le
h(z)
+
\big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top \big(x-\eta G_\eta(x)-z\big).
$$

This is the key line. Everything after this is expansion.

## Step 6: expand the vector $(x-\eta G_\eta(x)-z)$

Write

$$
x-\eta G_\eta(x)-z = (x-z)-\eta G_\eta(x).
$$

So

$$
h(x-\eta G_\eta(x))
\le
h(z)
+
\big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top(x-z)
- \eta \big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top G_\eta(x).
$$

## Step 7: expand the inner product with $G_\eta(x)$

Compute

$$
\big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top G_\eta(x)
=
G_\eta(x)^\top G_\eta(x) - \nabla g(x)^\top G_\eta(x).
$$

That is

$$
\|G_\eta(x)\|_2^2 - \nabla g(x)^\top G_\eta(x).
$$

Substitute back:

$$
h(x-\eta G_\eta(x))
\le
h(z)
+
\big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top(x-z)
- \eta\Big(\|G_\eta(x)\|_2^2 - \nabla g(x)^\top G_\eta(x)\Big).
$$

Distribute the $-\eta$:

$$
h(x-\eta G_\eta(x))
\le
h(z)
+
\big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top(x-z)
- \eta \|G_\eta(x)\|_2^2
+ \eta \nabla g(x)^\top G_\eta(x).
$$

## Step 8: rewrite the $(x-z)$ term in the homework's form

Use

$$
a^\top(x-z) = -a^\top(z-x).
$$

So

$$
\big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top(x-z)
=
-\big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top(z-x).
$$

Therefore

$$
h(x-\eta G_\eta(x))
\le
h(z)
- \eta \|G_\eta(x)\|_2^2
+ \eta \nabla g(x)^\top G_\eta(x)
- (G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x))^\top(z-x).
$$

That is exactly the statement in part `(b)`.

## What each term comes from

- $h(z)$ comes from the convexity inequality for $h$
- $-\eta \|G_\eta(x)\|^2$ comes from $- \eta \, G_\eta(x)^\top G_\eta(x)$
- $+\eta \nabla g(x)^\top G_\eta(x)$ comes from the cross term
- $-(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x))^\top(z-x)$ comes from the $y-z$ part of the convexity inequality

## Short version

The math of part `(b)` is:

1. prox definition gives an optimization problem
2. optimality of that problem gives a subgradient of $h$ at the prox point
3. convexity of $h$ turns that into an inequality
4. then you expand until it matches the homework statement

### Turn 15
User asked:

And when I say that I mean like Give me the problem and then like walk me through it step by step But don't give me the answer just like set it up So like I am kind of going through each of the steps and then I kind of like Am able to kind of discover the solution for myself and just guide me through it But don't like give me the straight-up answer

Assistant response:
Yes. Switching this thread into **guided problem-solving mode**.

Session rules from now on:
- one step at a time
- hints first
- I will not give the full answer unless you explicitly ask
- I will mostly ask you for the next setup move, then tighten it up

We will keep working on `Problem 1(b)`.

## Problem

Show that

$$
h(x-\eta G_\eta(x))
\le
h(z)
- \eta \|G_\eta(x)\|_2^2
+ \eta \nabla g(x)^\top G_\eta(x)
- (G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x))^\top(z-x).
$$

## Step 1

Before expanding anything, make the problem cleaner by introducing the prox point.

What point should we define as

$$
y := \; ?
$$

and why is that the natural first substitution for part `(b)`?

---
### Turn 16
User asked:
> y = prox(x - 1/n grad g(x))?

Assistant response:
Yes, very close. The main correction is the step size.

It should be

$$
y := \operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x-\eta \nabla g(x)).
$$

And because of the gradient-mapping definition, this is the same point as

$$
y = x-\eta G_\eta(x).
$$

Why this is the natural substitution:
- the left-hand side of the thing we want to prove is exactly $h(y)$
- the prox definition gives us optimality information at the point $y$
- that is what will let us get a subgradient of $h$ at $y$

So this substitution turns the problem from

$$
h(x-\eta G_\eta(x))
$$

into the cleaner object

$$
h(y).
$$

## Step 2

Now do the next setup move:

If

$$
y=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x-\eta \nabla g(x)),
$$

then what optimization problem is $y$ solving?

In other words, can you write

$$
y = \arg\min_u \; \cdots
$$

What goes inside that minimization?

---
### Turn 17
User asked:
> || u - y ||^2_2 + min(h(u)

Assistant response:
Very close. You have the right shape:

- a quadratic distance term
- plus $h(u)$

But there are two fixes:

1. the quadratic should be centered at the **input to the prox**, not at $y$
2. it needs the scaling factor $\frac{1}{2\eta}$

So the template is

$$
y = \arg\min_u \left( \frac{1}{2\eta}\|u-(\text{input to prox})\|_2^2 + h(u) \right).
$$

Now your job is just to fill in:

What is the input to the prox in this problem?

Once you say that, we can write the prox optimization problem correctly and move to the optimality condition.

---
### Turn 18
User asked:
> x - n grad g(x)

Assistant response:
Yes, that is the right object. The only correction is the symbol:

$$
x-\eta \nabla g(x).
$$

That is the input to the prox.

So now you can write the full optimization problem:

$$
y=\arg\min_u \left(\frac{1}{2\eta}\|u-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))\|_2^2 + h(u)\right).
$$

## Step 3

Now do the next move.

If $y$ minimizes that objective, what is the first-order optimality condition?

You do **not** need to expand everything yet.
Just tell me the general form:

$$
0 \in \; ?
$$

---
### Turn 19
User asked:
> subgrad(y)?

Assistant response:
Close, but make it one level more specific.

We do **not** want just

$$
\partial h(y).
$$

We want the subgradient of the **entire prox objective** at $y$.

So if we call the prox objective

$$
\phi(u)=\frac{1}{2\eta}\|u-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))\|_2^2+h(u),
$$

then the first-order optimality condition is

$$
0\in \partial \phi(y).
$$

That is the correct general form.

## Step 4

Now split that into its two pieces.

What should

$$
\partial \phi(y)
$$

equal?

Hint:
- the quadratic term is differentiable, so it contributes a gradient
- the $h(u)$ term contributes $\partial h(y)$

---
### Turn 20
User asked:
> grad (quadratic term) + subgrad(h(y))

Assistant response:
Yes. That is the right structure.

So you can write

$$
\partial \phi(y)
=
\nabla\!\left(\frac{1}{2\eta}\|u-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))\|_2^2\right)\Big|_{u=y}
+
\partial h(y).
$$

So the optimality condition becomes

$$
0 \in
\nabla\!\left(\frac{1}{2\eta}\|u-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))\|_2^2\right)\Big|_{u=y}
+
\partial h(y).
$$

## Step 5

Now compute just the gradient of the quadratic term.

What is

$$
\nabla_u \left(\frac{1}{2\eta}\|u-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))\|_2^2\right)?
$$

You can answer in the generic pattern first:

$$
\nabla_u \frac{1}{2\eta}\|u-a\|^2 = \; ?
$$

---
### Turn 21
User asked:
> 1/eta (u-a)?

Assistant response:
Yes, exactly.

$$
\nabla_u \frac{1}{2\eta}\|u-a\|^2
=
\frac{1}{\eta}(u-a).
$$

So in our case, with

$$
a = x-\eta \nabla g(x),
$$

the gradient term is

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}\Big(u-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))\Big).
$$

Then at $u=y$, it becomes

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}\Big(y-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))\Big).
$$

So the optimality condition is now

$$
0 \in \frac{1}{\eta}\Big(y-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))\Big) + \partial h(y).
$$

## Step 6

Now do the next algebra move.

Can you rearrange that so that the subgradient set is by itself on one side?

In other words, turn it into something of the form

$$
\text{(some vector)} \in \partial h(y).
$$

---
### Turn 22
User asked:
> Is it just 0 minus the 1 over eta times y minus parenthesis x minus eta times gradient of x g of x?

Assistant response:
Yes, that is basically the right algebra idea.

You are taking

$$
0 \in \frac{1}{\eta}\Big(y-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))\Big) + \partial h(y)
$$

and moving the vector term to the other side.

So yes, conceptually it is

$$
0 - \frac{1}{\eta}\Big(y-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))\Big).
$$

But the cleaner way to write it is to flip the order inside the parentheses:

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}\Big((x-\eta \nabla g(x)) - y\Big)\in \partial h(y).
$$

That is the form we want.

So you got the sign idea right.

## Step 7

Now do the substitution that makes this useful for the homework.

We know

$$
y=x-\eta G_\eta(x).
$$

Plug that into

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}\Big((x-\eta \nabla g(x)) - y\Big).
$$

What does that simplify to?

---
### Turn 23
User asked:
> Is it just capital GN of X minus the gradient of G of X?

Assistant response:
Yes, you have the right structure.

The only notation fix is:

- it is $G_\eta(x)$
- minus $\nabla g(x)$

So the simplified expression is

$$
G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x).
$$

Reason:

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}\Big((x-\eta \nabla g(x))-(x-\eta G_\eta(x))\Big)
$$

$$
=
\frac{1}{\eta}\Big(\eta G_\eta(x)-\eta \nabla g(x)\Big)
=
G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x).
$$

So now we know

$$
G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\in \partial h(y).
$$

That is the main bridge in part `(b)`.

## Step 8

Now use the convexity inequality for $h$.

If $s\in \partial h(y)$, then what inequality relates:

- $h(z)$
- $h(y)$
- and $s^\top(z-y)$?

You can write the standard convexity/subgradient inequality first.

---
### Turn 24
User asked:
> I forgot what the standard convexity, subgrating, inequality is. Can you give me like the general version of that again?

Assistant response:
Yes. The general subgradient inequality is:

If $f$ is convex and

$$
g \in \partial f(x),
$$

then for every $y$,

$$
f(y)\ge f(x)+g^\top(y-x).
$$

That is the standard version.

## How to read it

It says:
- pick a point $x$
- pick a subgradient $g$ at that point
- then the affine function

$$
f(x)+g^\top(y-x)
$$

sits below $f(y)$ for every $y$

So it is the nonsmooth version of the tangent-line / tangent-plane lower bound for convex functions.

## In your current notation

Right now we have

$$
s \in \partial h(y).
$$

So apply the general inequality with:

- $f = h$
- base point $x = y$
- subgradient $g = s$
- comparison point = $z$

That gives

$$
h(z)\ge h(y)+s^\top(z-y).
$$

That is the exact form you want first.

## The rearranged version you will actually use next

Since part `(b)` wants an upper bound on $h(y)$, rearrange:

$$
h(y)\le h(z)+s^\top(y-z).
$$

That rearranged form is the one we will plug into next.

## Step 9

Now use

$$
s = G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)
$$

and write the inequality for $h(y)$ in that form.

Can you write:

$$
h(y)\le \; ?
$$

---
### Turn 25
User asked:
> we have h(z) - s^T(y-z) >= h(y)

Assistant response:
Almost. You are very close, but the sign is off.

We start from

$$
h(z)\ge h(y)+s^\top(z-y).
$$

Now isolate $h(y)$:

$$
h(y)\le h(z)-s^\top(z-y).
$$

And since

$$
-s^\top(z-y)=s^\top(y-z),
$$

the cleaner version is

$$
h(y)\le h(z)+s^\top(y-z).
$$

That is the version we want.

So your issue was just this:

- the comparison term should be $z-y$ in the original inequality
- after rearranging, it becomes $y-z$

## Step 10

Now plug in

$$
s = G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x).
$$

What do you get for

$$

$$

Just substitute $s$ first. Do not expand $y-z$ yet.

### Turn 26
User asked:
> h(y) <= h(z) + (G_eta(x) - \grad g(x) )
>
> h(y) <= h(z) + s^T(G_eta(x) - \grad g(x) )

Assistant response:
Close, but you substituted into the wrong slot.

The expression is

$$
h(y)\le h(z)+s^\top(y-z).
$$

So when you replace $s$, you replace **only** the $s$:

$$
h(y)\le h(z)+\big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top (y-z).
$$

That is the correct next line.

So:
- the dot product stays there
- the second factor is still $(y-z)$
- you have **not** substituted for $y$ yet

## Step 11

Now do the next substitution:

$$
y=x-\eta G_\eta(x).
$$

What does

$$
\big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top (y-z)
$$

become after replacing $y$?

---
### Turn 27
User asked:
> (G_eta(x) - \grad g(x))^T (x - eta G_eta(x) - z)

Assistant response:
Yes. That is exactly the right substitution.

So now we have

$$
h(y)\le h(z)+\big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top\big(x-\eta G_\eta(x)-z\big).
$$

That is the key line.

## Step 12

Now do the next algebra move:

rewrite

$$
x-\eta G_\eta(x)-z
$$

as

$$
(x-z)-\eta G_\eta(x).
$$

Then distribute the inner product.

What do you get?

You should end up with **two terms** after the $h(z)$ term:

1. one involving $(x-z)$
2. one involving $-\eta G_\eta(x)$

---
### Turn 28

Assistant response:
I opened the image and checked your algebra.

You are on the right step.

The line

$$
h(y)\le h(z)+\big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top\big(x-\eta G_\eta(x)-z\big)
$$

should be rewritten as

$$
h(y)\le h(z)+\big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top\big((x-z)-\eta G_\eta(x)\big).
$$

Then distribute the inner product:

$$
h(y)\le h(z)
+
\big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top(x-z)
-
\eta\big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top G_\eta(x).
$$

So your overall structure is right.

The only things to tighten are:
- use $\eta$, not `n`
- keep the second term as one grouped inner product before expanding it further

## Next step

Do **not** expand everything at once.

Just focus on this piece:

$$
\big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top G_\eta(x).
$$

What does that become when you distribute the dot product?

---
### Turn 29
User asked:
> /Users/saahithjanapati/Downloads/IMG_7277.HEIC

Assistant response:
I checked the image. You are basically doing the right expansion.

The key piece is:

$$
\big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top G_\eta(x)
=
G_\eta(x)^\top G_\eta(x) - \nabla g(x)^\top G_\eta(x).
$$

Now tighten the notation:

$$
G_\eta(x)^\top G_\eta(x)=\|G_\eta(x)\|_2^2.
$$

So the clean version is

$$
\big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top G_\eta(x)
=
\|G_\eta(x)\|_2^2 - \nabla g(x)^\top G_\eta(x).
$$

So yes, your structure is right.

The two fixes are:
- write $\|G_\eta(x)\|_2^2$, not just `G^2`
- remember this whole quantity is still multiplied by the outside factor $-\eta$

So the next line should look like

$$
h(y)\le h(z)
+
\big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top(x-z)
-
\eta\Big(\|G_\eta(x)\|_2^2-\nabla g(x)^\top G_\eta(x)\Big).
$$

## Next step

Now do just one move:

distribute the $-\eta$ across the parentheses.

What two terms do you get?

---
### Turn 30
User asked:
> /Users/saahithjanapati/Downloads/IMG_7278.HEIC is this correct?

Assistant response:
Yes, mostly. You are essentially at the right line.

The clean version should be

$$
h(y)\le h(z)
+
\big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top(x-z)
- \eta \|G_\eta(x)\|_2^2
+ \eta \nabla g(x)^\top G_\eta(x).
$$

So your expansion of the $-\eta(\cdots)$ piece is correct.

The two cleanup points are:

1. use $\eta$, not `n`
2. keep the first inner-product term as

$$
\big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top(x-z)
$$

for one more line

## Next step

Now do the final rewrite that matches the homework statement:

$$
\big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top(x-z)
=
-\big(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\big)^\top(z-x).
$$

After that, you have exactly part `(b)`.

---
### Turn 31
User asked:

Assistant response:
I checked it. Yes, you are basically there.

Your final line has the right structure:

h(y)\le h(z)
- (G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x))^\top(z-x)
- \eta \|G_\eta(x)\|_2^2
+ \eta \nabla g(x)^\top G_\eta(x).
$$

That matches the target form.

The remaining cleanup is just:

1. use $\eta$, not `n`
2. write the norm as $\|G_\eta(x)\|_2^2$
3. replace $h(y)$ by the homework's notation

$$
y = x-\eta G_\eta(x)
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
h(y)=h(x-\eta G_\eta(x)).
$$

After that, you have exactly the displayed result in part `(b)`.

### Turn 32
User asked:
> So just to recap what we did here, we're trying to kind of come up with this inequality that describes how the prox point, like basically behaves with regards to the gradient of the point before the prox operation was formed and then the kind of generalized gradient at the point before the prox was formed. And the way we did this was by kind of messing around with the definition of what the prox point is exactly. And then also using the fact that at the prox point, zero is in the like, using the definition that it is like an optimality point of the function, like G plus H, and then kind of massaging that equation around and then using the inequality that the definition of the sub gradient, which is like H of Y, which is greater than or equal to H of Z plus ST times Y minus Z. Like that is the key equation that relates the sub gradient equation to like, that's how we kind of came up with this equation. Is that correct?

Assistant response:
Yes, that is very close.

The main idea you have is right:

- define the prox point
- use the optimality condition at that point
- extract a subgradient of $h$
- use the subgradient inequality for $h$
- expand

There are just two important corrections.

## Correction 1: the optimality condition is for the prox objective

It is **not** the optimality condition of $g+h$ directly.

It is the optimality condition for the prox problem

$$
\min_u \left(\frac{1}{2\eta}\|u-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))\|^2 + h(u)\right).
$$

So the object whose subgradient contains zero is

$$
\frac{1}{2\eta}\|u-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))\|^2 + h(u),
$$

not $g(u)+h(u)$.

That distinction matters.

## Correction 2: the subgradient inequality should be written carefully

If

$$
s\in \partial h(y),
$$

then the standard inequality is

$$
h(z)\ge h(y)+s^\top(z-y).
$$

And then we rearrange it into the form we need:

$$
h(y)\le h(z)+s^\top(y-z).
$$

So yes, this is the key inequality, but the point where the subgradient lives is $y$, not $z$.

## Clean recap

Here is the clean version of what we did:

1. define
$$
y=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x-\eta \nabla g(x))
$$

2. rewrite the prox definition as an optimization problem
$$
y=\arg\min_u \left(\frac{1}{2\eta}\|u-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))\|^2+h(u)\right)
$$

3. use first-order optimality of that prox problem to get
$$
\frac{1}{\eta}\Big((x-\eta \nabla g(x))-y\Big)\in \partial h(y)
$$

4. substitute
$$
y=x-\eta G_\eta(x)
$$
to turn that into
$$
G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\in \partial h(y)
$$

5. apply the subgradient inequality for $h$ at the point $y$

6. expand the algebra until it matches the homework statement

## One-sentence version

So the proof of part `(b)` is:

prox optimality gives the right subgradient of $h$ at the prox point, and then convexity of $h$ turns that into the inequality we wanted.

---
### Turn 33
User asked:
> And just to be clear, the definition of the sub-gradient equation is like f of y is greater than or equal to f of x plus the sub-gradient f of x times y minus x. Is that right?

Assistant response:
Yes, that is the right idea.

The clean notation is:

If

$$
g \in \partial f(x),
$$

then for every $y$,

$$
f(y)\ge f(x)+g^\top (y-x).
$$

So the important notation fix is:

- the subgradient is a vector $g$
- and it belongs to the subdifferential set $\partial f(x)$

It is not usually written as "the subgradient $f(x)$."

## Definition of the subdifferential

The full set is

$$
\partial f(x)
=
\left\{
g:\; f(y)\ge f(x)+g^\top(y-x)\ \text{for all } y
\right\}.
$$

So:

- a **subgradient** is one vector $g$
- the **subdifferential** is the whole set $\partial f(x)$

## In your current proof

We had

$$
s\in \partial h(y),
$$

so the inequality becomes

$$
h(z)\ge h(y)+s^\top(z-y).
$$

That is just the same general rule with:

- $f=h$
- base point $x=y$
- comparison point $y=z$

### Turn 34
User asked:
> Okay, can you guide me to the part C now?

Assistant response:
Yes. We now switch to **guided problem-solving for part `(c)`**.

Rule stays the same:
- one step at a time
- hints first
- no full answer unless you ask for it

## What part `(c)` is asking you to do

Part `(c)` is not a brand-new idea.

It is basically:

1. take the inequality from part `(a)` for $g$
2. take the inequality from part `(b)` for $h$
3. add them
4. simplify until you get the final displayed bound

So this part is mostly about **combining the two previous pieces cleanly**.

## Step 1

Before adding anything, tell me:

What does the left-hand side become when you add the left-hand side from `(a)` and the left-hand side from `(b)`?

In other words, if you add

$$
g(x-\eta G_\eta(x))
$$

and

$$
h(x-\eta G_\eta(x)),
$$

what do you get?

---
### Turn 35
User asked:
> (g+h)(x - nG_n(x))

Assistant response:
Yes, exactly. The only fix is notation:

$$
(g+h)(x-\eta G_\eta(x)).
$$

And since

$$
f = g+h,
$$

this is just

$$
f(x-\eta G_\eta(x)).
$$

That is the left-hand side of the final result we want.

## Step 2

Now think about the **right-hand side** when you add `(a)` and `(b)`.

From part `(a)` you have a term involving:

$$
g(x), \quad -\eta \nabla g(x)^\top G_\eta(x), \quad \text{and a } \|G_\eta(x)\|^2 \text{ term.}
$$

From part `(b)` you have:

$$
h(z), \quad +\eta \nabla g(x)^\top G_\eta(x), \quad -\eta \|G_\eta(x)\|^2, \quad \text{and another inner-product term.}
$$

Which two terms do you expect to interact nicely or cancel when you add the inequalities?

---
### Turn 36
User asked:
> I think the minus eta times gradient g of x transpose times generalized like big G and x plus the eta gradient gx transpose g n x thus two would cancel when you add the two.

Assistant response:
Yes, exactly.

These two cancel:

$$
-\eta \nabla g(x)^\top G_\eta(x)
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
+\eta \nabla g(x)^\top G_\eta(x).
$$

That is the main cancellation in part `(c)`.

## Step 3

After that cancellation, focus on the $\|G_\eta(x)\|^2$ terms.

From part `(a)`, after using smoothness, you should have a positive quadratic term of the form

$$
\frac{\eta^2\beta}{2}\|G_\eta(x)\|_2^2.
$$

From part `(b)`, you have

$$
-\eta \|G_\eta(x)\|_2^2.
$$

Now combine those.

What coefficient multiplies $\|G_\eta(x)\|_2^2$ after you add them?

You can leave it in unsimplified form first.

---
### Turn 37
User asked:
> I guess it would just be eta squared b beta over 2 minus eta, right?

Assistant response:
Yes, exactly.

The coefficient is

$$
\frac{\eta^2\beta}{2}-\eta.
$$

So at this stage the norm term becomes

$$
\left(\frac{\eta^2\beta}{2}-\eta\right)\|G_\eta(x)\|_2^2.
$$

## Step 4

Now use the assumption

$$
\eta \le \frac{1}{\beta}.
$$

What does that tell you about

$$
\frac{\eta^2\beta}{2}-\eta \; ?
$$

Hint:

factor out $\eta$ first:

$$
\frac{\eta^2\beta}{2}-\eta
=
\eta\left(\frac{\eta\beta}{2}-1\right).
$$

---
### Turn 38
User asked:
> Well, we know that the left-hand side term and eta times beta over 2 is going to be less than... It's going to be less than one half, which means that that whole term in the parentheses is going to be less than negative one half, which means that we basically have to... like, yeah, that term is going to be small. Inside the parentheses is going to be less than one half. I mean negative one half, so then the whole term is going to be negative.

Assistant response:
Yes, that is the right idea. Let me tighten it.

Since

$$
\eta \le \frac{1}{\beta},
$$

we get

$$
\eta\beta \le 1.
$$

So

$$
\frac{\eta\beta}{2}\le \frac{1}{2}.
$$

Therefore

$$
\frac{\eta\beta}{2}-1 \le -\frac{1}{2}.
$$

Multiply by $\eta>0$:

$$
\eta\left(\frac{\eta\beta}{2}-1\right)\le -\frac{\eta}{2}.
$$

So the coefficient satisfies

$$
\frac{\eta^2\beta}{2}-\eta \le -\frac{\eta}{2}.
$$

That is exactly how the ugly coefficient turns into the clean final term

$$
-\frac{\eta}{2}\|G_\eta(x)\|_2^2.
$$

## Step 5

Now there is one more structural piece in part `(c)`.

You still need the term

$$
f(z) + G_\eta(x)^\top(x-z)
$$

to appear in the final result.

From the pieces we added, we already have:

- the $h(z)$ term from part `(b)`
- and from the $g$ side, you should have a combination involving $g(x)$ and $\nabla g(x)^\top(x-z)$

What theorem/inequality about **strong convexity of $g$** do we use to replace those $g$-terms by something involving

$$
g(z) - \frac{\alpha}{2}\|x-z\|^2 \; ?
$$

---
### Turn 39
User asked:
> /Users/saahithjanapati/Downloads/IMG_7280.HEIC how does this look

Assistant response:
This looks good. You are taking the right route.

The key finish is:

after combining parts `(a)` and `(b)`, and after using

$$
\frac{\eta^2\beta}{2}-\eta \le -\frac{\eta}{2},
$$

you want to group the remaining terms as

$$
\big(g(x)-\nabla g(x)^\top(x-z)\big)
+
h(z)
+
G_\eta(x)^\top(x-z)
-
\frac{\eta}{2}\|G_\eta(x)\|_2^2.
$$

That grouping is the important part.

Then strong convexity gives

$$
g(z)\ge g(x)+\nabla g(x)^\top(z-x)+\frac{\alpha}{2}\|x-z\|^2,
$$

which is equivalent to

$$
g(x)-\nabla g(x)^\top(x-z)
\le
g(z)-\frac{\alpha}{2}\|x-z\|^2.
$$

That is the substitution you want to make.

Then the $g(z)+h(z)$ piece becomes

$$
f(z),
$$

and you are done.

## So the verdict

Yes, your page is basically correct.

The one thing I would emphasize if you rewrite it cleanly is:

bundle

$$
g(x)-\nabla g(x)^\top(x-z)
$$

together before applying strong convexity.

### Turn 40
User asked:

More precisely:
- you derived the part `(b)` inequality from the prox definition
- you combined `(a)` and `(b)` in part `(c)`
- you used the step-size condition and strong convexity in the right places

That is the full proof structure for `1.1`.

---
### Turn 41
User asked:
> yea sure, let's hit 1.2

Assistant response:
Yes. We now switch to **guided problem-solving for `1.2`**.

Goal:

show the proximal iterations with step size

$$
\eta = \frac{1}{\beta}
$$

have the linear rate

$$
\|x^k-x^*\|_2^2 \le \left(1-\frac{1}{\kappa}\right)^k \|x^0-x^*\|_2^2,
\qquad
\kappa=\frac{\beta}{\alpha}.
$$

## Big picture

For `1.2`, we are going to use the lemma from `1.1` with a smart choice of `z`.

This is not a new proof from scratch.

It is:

1. plug the optimizer $x^*$ into the lemma
2. simplify using optimality of $x^*$
3. turn the result into a contraction on $\|x^k-x^*\|^2$

## Step 1

In the lemma from `1.1`, there is a free comparison point $z$.

What is the most natural choice of $z$ for proving convergence to the optimum?

---
### Turn 42
User asked:
> Would it be the optimum itself?

Assistant response:
Yes, exactly.

Choose

$$
z=x^*.
$$

That is the natural choice because the whole goal is to compare the current iterate to the optimizer.

## Step 2

Now apply the lemma from `1.1` with:

- $x = x^k$
- $z = x^*$
- $\eta = \frac{1}{\beta}$

Also remember the proximal update is

$$
x^{k+1}=x^k-\eta G_\eta(x^k).
$$

So the left-hand side of the lemma becomes

$$
f(x^{k+1}).
$$

What does the **right-hand side** become after substituting $x=x^k$ and $z=x^*$?

---
### Turn 43
User asked:
> /Users/saahithjanapati/Downloads/IMG_7281.HEIC does this look right?

Assistant response:
Yes. The structure is right.

You are plugging

- $x=x^k$
- $z=x^*$

into the lemma from `1.1`, so the clean version is

$$
f(x^{k+1})
\le
f(x^*)
+
G_\eta(x^k)^\top(x^k-x^*)
-
\frac{\eta}{2}\|G_\eta(x^k)\|_2^2
-
\frac{\alpha}{2}\|x^k-x^*\|_2^2.
$$

So yes, that is the right substitution.

The only cleanup is notation:
- write $x^{k+1}$ on the left if you want to emphasize the update
- keep the $G_\eta(x^k)$ dependence explicit

## Step 3

Now use the fact that $x^*$ is optimal.

Since $x^*$ minimizes $f$, what inequality relates

$$
f(x^*)
\quad\text{and}\quad
f(x^{k+1})?
$$

Once you write that, we can combine it with the lemma and eliminate the function values.

---
### Turn 44
User asked:
> i mean, by definition, we know that f(x*) <= f(x^(k+1)), right

Assistant response:
Yes, exactly.

Since $x^*$ is the minimizer,

$$
f(x^*) \le f(x^{k+1}).
$$

Now combine that with the lemma:

$$
f(x^{k+1})
\le
f(x^*)
+
G_\eta(x^k)^\top(x^k-x^*)
-
\frac{\eta}{2}\|G_\eta(x^k)\|_2^2
-
\frac{\alpha}{2}\|x^k-x^*\|_2^2.
$$

So the function values are squeezed:

$$
f(x^*)
\le
f(x^{k+1})
\le
f(x^*)
+
G_\eta(x^k)^\top(x^k-x^*)
-
\frac{\eta}{2}\|G_\eta(x^k)\|_2^2
-
\frac{\alpha}{2}\|x^k-x^*\|_2^2.
$$

## Step 4

What must therefore be true about

$$
G_\eta(x^k)^\top(x^k-x^*)
-
\frac{\eta}{2}\|G_\eta(x^k)\|_2^2
-
\frac{\alpha}{2}\|x^k-x^*\|_2^2 \; ?
$$

Think: if $A \le f(x^{k+1}) \le A + B$, what must be true about $B$?

---
### Turn 45
User asked:
> It must be positive or like non-negative, right?

Assistant response:
Yes, exactly.

It must be **nonnegative**.

So we get

$$
G_\eta(x^k)^\top(x^k-x^*)
-
\frac{\eta}{2}\|G_\eta(x^k)\|_2^2
-
\frac{\alpha}{2}\|x^k-x^*\|_2^2
\ge 0.
$$

## Step 5

Now rearrange that inequality so the inner product term is by itself on the left.

In other words, what lower bound do you get for

$$
G_\eta(x^k)^\top(x^k-x^*) \; ?
$$

---
### Turn 46
User asked:
> /Users/saahithjanapati/Downloads/IMG_7282.HEIC

Assistant response:
I checked it. Yes, that rearrangement is correct.

You got

$$
G_\eta(x^k)^\top(x^k-x^*)
\ge
\frac{\eta}{2}\|G_\eta(x^k)\|_2^2
+
\frac{\alpha}{2}\|x^k-x^*\|_2^2.
$$

That is exactly the lower bound we want.

## Step 6

Now we use the standard distance-recursion trick.

Since

$$
x^{k+1}=x^k-\eta G_\eta(x^k),
$$

write down

$$
\|x^{k+1}-x^*\|_2^2
$$

by substituting the update and expanding the square.

In other words:

$$
\|x^k-\eta G_\eta(x^k)-x^*\|_2^2
=
\; ?
$$

This is the same expansion pattern as in ordinary gradient-descent proofs.

---
### Turn 47
User asked:
> how do u do that?

Assistant response:
Use the identity

$$
\|a-b\|^2 = \|a\|^2 - 2a^\top b + \|b\|^2.
$$

Here, set

$$
a = x^k-x^*,
\qquad
b = \eta G_\eta(x^k).
$$

Then

$$
\|x^{k+1}-x^*\|_2^2
=
\|x^k-\eta G_\eta(x^k)-x^*\|_2^2
$$

$$
=
\|(x^k-x^*)-\eta G_\eta(x^k)\|_2^2
$$

$$
=
\|x^k-x^*\|_2^2
-2\eta\, G_\eta(x^k)^\top(x^k-x^*)
+\eta^2\|G_\eta(x^k)\|_2^2.
$$

That is the expansion you want.

## Step 7

Now use the lower bound you already proved:

$$
G_\eta(x^k)^\top(x^k-x^*)
\ge
\frac{\eta}{2}\|G_\eta(x^k)\|_2^2
+
\frac{\alpha}{2}\|x^k-x^*\|_2^2.
$$

Substitute that into the middle term

$$
-2\eta\, G_\eta(x^k)^\top(x^k-x^*).
$$

What do you get after that substitution?

---
### Turn 48
User asked:
> /Users/saahithjanapati/Downloads/IMG_7283.HEIC how is this?

Assistant response:
You are very close. The expansion line is right, but the substitution step needs one important cleanup.

You had

$$
\|x^{k+1}-x^*\|_2^2
=
\|x^k-x^*\|_2^2
-2\eta\, G_\eta(x^k)^\top(x^k-x^*)
+\eta^2\|G_\eta(x^k)\|_2^2.
$$

And you proved

$$
G_\eta(x^k)^\top(x^k-x^*)
\ge
\frac{\eta}{2}\|G_\eta(x^k)\|_2^2
+
\frac{\alpha}{2}\|x^k-x^*\|_2^2.
$$

So when you substitute into the middle term, you replace the **entire scalar inner product** by that lower bound:

$$
-2\eta\, G_\eta(x^k)^\top(x^k-x^*)
\le
-2\eta\left(
\frac{\eta}{2}\|G_\eta(x^k)\|_2^2
+
\frac{\alpha}{2}\|x^k-x^*\|_2^2
\right).
$$

So after substitution there should be **no remaining inner product term**.

The next line should be

$$
\|x^{k+1}-x^*\|_2^2
\le
\|x^k-x^*\|_2^2
-2\eta\left(
\frac{\eta}{2}\|G_\eta(x^k)\|_2^2
+
\frac{\alpha}{2}\|x^k-x^*\|_2^2
\right)
+\eta^2\|G_\eta(x^k)\|_2^2.
$$

## Step 8

Now just distribute the $-2\eta$.

What two terms do you get from

$$
-2\eta\left(
\frac{\eta}{2}\|G_\eta(x^k)\|_2^2
+
\frac{\alpha}{2}\|x^k-x^*\|_2^2
\right)?
$$

> I ended up getting, like when I simplify everything, that like xk+1-x^2 minus alpha times eta times the xk-x*^2, whatever.

Assistant response:
Yes, that means you are basically at the key contraction step.

Let me write the clean version of what you should have.

After distributing the $-2\eta$, you get

$$
-\eta^2\|G_\eta(x^k)\|_2^2
-\alpha\eta \|x^k-x^*\|_2^2.
$$

So the recursion becomes

$$
\|x^{k+1}-x^*\|_2^2
\le
\|x^k-x^*\|_2^2
-\eta^2\|G_\eta(x^k)\|_2^2
-\alpha\eta \|x^k-x^*\|_2^2
+\eta^2\|G_\eta(x^k)\|_2^2.
$$

Now the $\eta^2\|G_\eta(x^k)\|_2^2$ terms cancel.

So you get

$$
\|x^{k+1}-x^*\|_2^2
\le
\|x^k-x^*\|_2^2
-\alpha\eta \|x^k-x^*\|_2^2.
$$

Factor the right-hand side:

$$
\|x^{k+1}-x^*\|_2^2
\le
(1-\alpha\eta)\|x^k-x^*\|_2^2.
$$

That is the one-step contraction.

## Step 9

Now use the chosen step size

$$
\eta=\frac{1}{\beta}.
$$

What does

$$
1-\alpha\eta
$$

become in terms of $\kappa=\frac{\beta}{\alpha}$?

User asked:
> It becomes 1 over... I mean, sorry, 1 minus 1 over k.

Assistant response:
Yes, exactly, with one notation cleanup:

it is

$$
1-\frac{1}{\kappa},
$$

not $1-\frac{1}{k}$.

Because

$$
\eta=\frac{1}{\beta}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\alpha\eta=\frac{\alpha}{\beta}=\frac{1}{\kappa}.
$$

So the recursion becomes

$$
\|x^{k+1}-x^*\|_2^2
\le
\left(1-\frac{1}{\kappa}\right)\|x^k-x^*\|_2^2.
$$

## Final step

Now how do you go from the one-step recursion

$$
\|x^{k+1}-x^*\|_2^2
\le
\left(1-\frac{1}{\kappa}\right)\|x^k-x^*\|_2^2
$$

to the full statement

$$
\|x^{k}-x^*\|_2^2
\le
\left(1-\frac{1}{\kappa}\right)^k \|x^0-x^*\|_2^2?
$$

What proof move do you use there?

### Turn 51
User asked:
> Is it just like induction? Because like for x zero to go to x one, it's just one minus one over k and then you can just keep doing that for between k and k plus one.

Assistant response:
Yes. Induction is exactly the clean proof move.

You can also think of it as "unrolling the recursion," but induction is the standard formal writeup.

The recursion is

$$
\|x^{k+1}-x^*\|_2^2
\le
\left(1-\frac{1}{\kappa}\right)\|x^k-x^*\|_2^2.
$$

Then:

- base case: for $k=0$, the statement is immediate
- inductive step: assume

$$
\|x^k-x^*\|_2^2
\le
\left(1-\frac{1}{\kappa}\right)^k\|x^0-x^*\|_2^2
$$

Then apply the one-step recursion:

$$
\|x^{k+1}-x^*\|_2^2
\le
\left(1-\frac{1}{\kappa}\right)\|x^k-x^*\|_2^2
$$

$$
\le
\left(1-\frac{1}{\kappa}\right)
\left(1-\frac{1}{\kappa}\right)^k
\|x^0-x^*\|_2^2
$$

$$
=
\left(1-\frac{1}{\kappa}\right)^{k+1}\|x^0-x^*\|_2^2.
$$

That finishes the proof.

## Verdict

Yes, that completes `1.2`.

So now you have the full flow:

- `1.1(a)`: smoothness on $g$
- `1.1(b)`: prox optimality + convexity of $h$
- `1.1(c)`: combine and use strong convexity
- `1.2`: plug in $x^*$, derive one-step contraction, then unroll by induction
