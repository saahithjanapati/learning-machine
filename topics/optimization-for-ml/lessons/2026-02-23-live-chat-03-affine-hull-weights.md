## Response 1

User asked:
> $$
> \mathrm{Aff}(C)=\left\{\sum_{i=1}^k \theta_i x_i:\sum_i\theta_i=1\right\}.
> $$
> is affine set, do we have weights for each index position in vector x?

Assistant response:
In that definition, weights are per **point** $x_i$, not per coordinate position of a vector.

- $i$ indexes points $x_i \in C$.
- Each $\theta_i$ is a scalar.
- The same $\theta_i$ is applied to all coordinates of $x_i$.

If $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and
$$
y=\sum_{i=1}^k \theta_i x_i,
$$
then coordinate-wise:
$$
y_j=\sum_{i=1}^k \theta_i (x_i)_j,\quad j=1,\dots,n.
$$

So there is not a separate weight per coordinate (no $\theta_{ij}$ in this definition).

Also: affine combination requires
$$
\sum_i \theta_i=1,
$$
and $\theta_i$ may be negative.

## Response 2

User asked:
> can you make a new live chat file with your response/answer?

Assistant response:
Created this file:
[topics/optimization-for-ml/lessons/2026-02-23-live-chat-03-affine-hull-weights.md](2026-02-23-live-chat-03-affine-hull-weights.md)

---

## Response 3

User asked:
> So we have a point, we have a weight, theta i for each point xi.

Assistant response:
Yes.

In an affine combination,
$$
x=\sum_{i=1}^k \theta_i x_i,\qquad \sum_{i=1}^k \theta_i=1.
$$

Each point $x_i$ has one scalar weight $\theta_i$, and there is no separate coordinate-wise weight.

If it is a convex combination, add:
$$
\theta_i\ge 0\quad \forall i.
$$

## Response 4

User asked:
> Can you please just add all the responses to the live chat like we do in the other files?

Assistant response:
Yes. This file was updated to the same numbered live-chat response style and now includes all responses in this thread.

---

## Response 5

User asked:
> So in an affine combination, you can't have a point that doesn't have an associated weight with it.

Assistant response:
Yes, for any point that appears in the written combination.

If you write
$$
x=\sum_{i=1}^k \theta_i x_i,\quad \sum_{i=1}^k \theta_i=1,
$$
then each listed $x_i$ has a corresponding weight $\theta_i$.

A point from $C$ can be absent from that particular combination (equivalently, think of its weight as $0$).

---

## Response 6

User asked:
> Please continue to add in the live chat for every question that I ask.

Assistant response:
Yes. I will continue adding every question/response pair to this live chat file for each new turn.

## Response 7

User asked:
> But then, are you guaranteed that the resulting x that's the weighted sum is one of the xi's? Or can that be something that's not in the xi's?

Assistant response:
Not guaranteed to be one of the listed points $x_i$.

Usually, the weighted sum gives a new point.

Example:
$$
x_1=0,\quad x_2=2,\quad \theta_1=\theta_2=\frac12
\Rightarrow
x=\frac12 x_1+\frac12 x_2=1,
$$
and $1$ is not equal to either $0$ or $2$.

It equals one of the $x_i$ only in special cases (for example, one-hot weights like $\theta_j=1$ and all others $0$).

---

## Response 8

User asked:
> So alternatively, you could just like multiply all the xi points by their actual weight and just set all the weights to one, right?

Assistant response:
Numerically, yes, you can pre-scale and then sum:
$$
\sum_i \theta_i x_i = \sum_i (1)\,(\theta_i x_i).
$$

But conceptually for affine combinations, the weights are the $\theta_i$ on the original points $x_i$ and must satisfy:
$$
\sum_i \theta_i = 1.
$$

If you replace coefficients by all ones, then those are no longer affine-combination coefficients (unless there is only one term).

So pre-scaling is an algebra trick for computation, but the affine-combination definition still uses the original weights $\theta_i$.

---
## Response 9

User asked:
> So is a convex hull kind of like a more complicated version of a affine set where, you know, we have some set S and then we're doing these like combinations of the values in the set with non-negative weights?

Assistant response:
Very close. The clean relationship is:

- **Affine hull**:
$$
\mathrm{Aff}(S)=\left\{\sum_i \theta_i x_i:\ x_i\in S,\ \sum_i \theta_i=1\right\},
$$
where weights can be negative.

- **Convex hull**:
$$
\mathrm{conv}(S)=\left\{\sum_i \theta_i x_i:\ x_i\in S,\ \theta_i\ge 0,\ \sum_i \theta_i=1\right\}.
$$

So convex hull is not a more complicated affine hull; it is a **stricter** version (same affine-sum rule, plus non-negativity).

Hence:
$$
\mathrm{conv}(S)\subseteq \mathrm{Aff}(S).
$$

---

## Response 10

User asked:
> What's an affine set versus an affine hull?

Assistant response:

- **Affine set**: a set that is already affine (closed under affine combinations).
  Equivalent test:
  if $x,y\in C$ and $t\in\mathbb{R}$, then
  $$
  tx+(1-t)y\in C.
  $$

- **Affine hull** of a set $S$:
  $$
  \mathrm{Aff}(S),
  $$
  the smallest affine set containing $S$.

So:
- "Affine set" is a property a set may have.
- "Affine hull" is an operation applied to any set to produce the minimal affine superset.

Example:
- If $S=\{(0,0),(1,0)\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, then $S$ is not affine (just two points),
  but
  $$
  \mathrm{Aff}(S)=\{(t,0): t\in\mathbb{R}\},
  $$
  the full line through them.

---

## Response 11

User asked:
> So like in the con-- in the convex hull, can you apply multiple kind of like weight combinations on the xi terms? Like so like is one element if you set one for the first element and zero for everything else? Whereas another element in your set is if you have zero for everything and another element is if you put zero for everything except the last one and for the last one you put one. And sorry, I guess the zero for everything wouldn't work because they have to sum to one but would the other two combinations be elements of the convex set of S?

Assistant response:
Yes, exactly.

In the convex hull, you are allowed to choose many different valid weight vectors $(\theta_1,\dots,\theta_k)$, as long as:
$$
\theta_i\ge 0,\qquad \sum_i \theta_i=1.
$$

Each valid choice gives one element of $\mathrm{conv}(S)$.

- One-hot choice $(1,0,\dots,0)$ gives $x_1$.
- One-hot choice $(0,\dots,0,1)$ gives the last point $x_k$.
- All-zero weights are not allowed, because they sum to $0$, not $1$.

So yes, your two one-hot examples are elements of $\mathrm{conv}(S)$, and this also shows every point in $S$ is automatically in its convex hull.

## Response 12

User asked:
> can you go into depth on the polar, normal, and tangent cones section? i didn't really understand...

Assistant response:
Absolutely. Here is the clean geometric picture.

### 1) Polar cone (algebraic definition)

For a cone $K$, the polar cone is
$$
K^\circ=\{y:\ y^Tx\le 0,\ \forall x\in K\}.
$$

Interpretation:
- $y$ is in $K^\circ$ if it makes an obtuse-or-right angle with every direction in $K$.
- So $K^\circ$ is the set of directions that "push against" all directions in $K$.

---

### 2) Normal cone at a point

Given set $C$ and point $x\in C$:
$$
N_C(x)=\{g:\ g^T(y-x)\le 0,\ \forall y\in C\}.
$$

Interpretation:
- $y-x$ are directions from $x$ to feasible points.
- $g$ is normal if it has nonpositive dot product with every feasible direction.
- So $g$ points outward from the feasible set at $x$.

What it looks like:
- If $x$ is interior: $N_C(x)=\{0\}$.
- Smooth boundary: one outward ray.
- Corner point: a wedge/fat cone of outward directions.

---

### 3) Tangent cone at a point

$T_C(x)$ is the cone of feasible local movement directions from $x$.

Interpretation:
- If $d\in T_C(x)$, then moving a little from $x$ along $d$ stays in (or approaches staying in) $C$.
- Tangent directions point "into/along" the set boundary.

For convex $C$:
$$
T_C(x)=N_C(x)^\circ.
$$

So tangent and normal are polar duals at the same point.

---

### 4) Concrete example: halfspace

Let
$$
C=\{z:\ a^Tz\le b\}.
$$

At interior point $x$ with $a^Tx<b$:
- $N_C(x)=\{0\}$,
- $T_C(x)=\mathbb{R}^n$.

At boundary point $x$ with $a^Tx=b$:
- $N_C(x)=\{\lambda a:\lambda\ge 0\}$,
- $T_C(x)=\{d:\ a^Td\le 0\}$.

This matches intuition:
- normal points outward along $a$,
- tangent directions are those not moving outside the halfspace.

---

### 5) Concrete example: nonnegative orthant in $\mathbb{R}^2$

Let $C=\mathbb{R}_+^2$.

At origin $x=(0,0)$:
- $T_C(x)=\mathbb{R}_+^2$ (you can only move into first quadrant),
- $N_C(x)=\mathbb{R}_-^2$ (outward opposing cone).

At interior point $x=(1,1)$:
- $T_C(x)=\mathbb{R}^2$,
- $N_C(x)=\{0\}$.

At boundary point $x=(0,1)$:
- $T_C(x)=\{d:\ d_1\ge 0\}$,
- $N_C(x)=\{(-\lambda,0):\lambda\ge 0\}$.

---

### 6) Why this matters in optimization

For
$$
\min_{x\in C} f(x),\quad f\text{ convex, differentiable},
$$
optimality can be written as:
$$
-\nabla f(x^*)\in N_C(x^*).
$$

Equivalent tangent form:
$$
\nabla f(x^*)^Td\ge 0,\quad \forall d\in T_C(x^*).
$$

Meaning:
- at optimum, every feasible local direction has nonnegative directional derivative,
- so no feasible first-order descent direction exists.

---

### 7) Memory summary

- Tangent cone = feasible movement directions.
- Normal cone = outward blockers at that point.
- Polar cone = dual cone by dot-product inequality.
- For convex sets: tangent and normal are polar duals.

## Response 13

User asked:
> is it possible to add some visualizations/graphics to help me understand in the response you just added?

Assistant response:
Yes. Added three local visuals below.

### A) Halfspace boundary: normal vs tangent

![Halfspace normal and tangent cone](../../../materials/archive/local-figures/cone-halfspace-normal-tangent.png)

How to read:
- Green region is feasible set $C$.
- Blue shading (left half-plane at the boundary point) is $T_C(x)$.
- Red ray is $N_C(x)$.

### B) Orthant at the origin

![Orthant tangent and normal cone](../../../materials/archive/local-figures/cone-orthant-normal-tangent.png)

How to read:
- First quadrant is $C=\mathbb{R}_+^2$.
- Blue wedge (first quadrant) is $T_C(0)$.
- Red wedge (third quadrant) is $N_C(0)$.

### C) Polar cone duality picture

![Polar cone duality](../../../materials/archive/local-figures/cone-polar-duality.png)

How to read:
- Blue wedge is cone $K$.
- Red wedge is polar cone $K^\circ$.
- Red directions have nonpositive dot product with every blue direction.

## Response 14

User asked:
> For the definition for normal cone at C, both Y and X are in C, right? So we're like, we have some line that's like inside the cone and then this G, like this normal cone is like consisting of all the vectors that have a right or obtuse angle to that vector, is that right?

Assistant response:
Yes, your core intuition is right.

For
$$
N_C(x)=\{g:\ g^T(y-x)\le 0,\ \forall y\in C\},
$$
- $x$ is a fixed point in $C$,
- $y$ ranges over all points in $C$,
so both are in $C$.

And yes: $g^T(y-x)\le 0$ means the angle between $g$ and $(y-x)$ is right or obtuse (or one vector is zero).

Small precision:
- it is not one single line/vector, but **all** feasible displacement vectors $(y-x)$ from $x$ to points in $C$.
- $g$ is in the normal cone only if it is right/obtuse to every such displacement direction.

So your sentence is correct after replacing “that vector” with “every feasible displacement vector from $x$ into $C$”.

---

## Response 15

User asked:
> Is the epigraph of a function a set?

Assistant response:
Yes. The epigraph is a set in a higher-dimensional space.

For $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$,
$$
\mathrm{epi}(f)=\{(x,t)\in\mathbb{R}^{n+1}: t\ge f(x)\}.
$$

So it is the set of all points on or above the graph of $f$.

---

## Response 16

User asked:
> can you explain the 1d slice test for convexity?

Assistant response:
Yes.

For a function $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$, define a line through point $x$ in direction $v$:
$$
\ell(t)=x+tv.
$$

Now restrict $f$ to that line:
$$
g(t)=f(x+tv).
$$

The 1D slice test says:
- $f$ is convex on its domain **iff** every such slice $g(t)$ is a convex 1D function (for all $x,v$).

Geometric intuition:
- A multivariable function is convex if every line cut through its graph looks convex.

Why this is useful:
- Checking convexity in $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be hard.
- 1D convexity is easier (second derivative, chord test, etc.).

Practical use:
1. Pick arbitrary $x,v$.
2. Form $g(t)=f(x+tv)$.
3. Show $g$ is convex in $t$ (often by proving $g''(t)\ge 0$ where differentiable).
4. Since $x,v$ were arbitrary, conclude $f$ is convex.

Quick example:
$$
f(z)=\|z\|_2^2,\quad g(t)=\|x+tv\|_2^2.
$$
Expand:
$$
g(t)=\|x\|_2^2+2t\,x^Tv+t^2\|v\|_2^2,
$$
so
$$
g''(t)=2\|v\|_2^2\ge 0.
$$
Hence each slice is convex, so $f$ is convex.

## Response 17

User asked:
> can you explain the definition of spectral radius

Assistant response:
Yes.

For a square matrix $A$, the spectral radius is
$$
\rho(A)=\max\{|\lambda|:\lambda\in\Lambda(A)\},
$$
where $\Lambda(A)$ is the set of eigenvalues of $A$.

So it is the largest absolute value among eigenvalues.

Intuition:
- eigenvalues describe how $A$ scales vectors in eigen-directions,
- spectral radius is the biggest per-step scaling magnitude along those directions.

Why it matters:
- if $\rho(A)<1$, powers of the matrix shrink and typically $A^t\to 0$ (under the standard square-matrix setting from class).
- if $\rho(A)>1$, some direction expands.

Quick example:
$$
A=\begin{bmatrix}2&0\\0&-0.5\end{bmatrix}
$$
has eigenvalues $2$ and $-0.5$, so
$$
\rho(A)=\max\{|2|,|{-0.5}|\}=2.
$$

---

## Response 18

User asked:
> Can you explain the spectral theorem?

Assistant response:
Yes.

For real matrices, the class version is:

If $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is **symmetric** ($A=A^T$), then:
1. all eigenvalues are real,
2. there is an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors,
3. and
$$
A=Q\Lambda Q^T,
$$
where $Q$ is orthogonal ($Q^TQ=I$) and $\Lambda$ is diagonal with eigenvalues.

Meaning:
- symmetric matrices can be rotated into coordinates where they are diagonal.
- in that basis, $A$ acts by scaling each coordinate by an eigenvalue.

Why useful:
- easy PSD test (all eigenvalues $\ge 0$),
- easy powers: $A^k=Q\Lambda^kQ^T$,
- clean norm/eigenvalue relations for symmetric matrices.

Example:
$$
A=\begin{bmatrix}2&1\\1&2\end{bmatrix}
$$
is symmetric, so it admits
$$
A=Q\begin{bmatrix}3&0\\0&1\end{bmatrix}Q^T
$$
for an orthogonal matrix $Q$ made from orthonormal eigenvectors.

Important caveat:
- this orthogonal diagonalization guarantee is for symmetric (or Hermitian) matrices.
- general nonsymmetric matrices may fail to be orthogonally diagonalizable.

---

## Response 19

User asked:
> So Q has like columns that are the eigenvectors.

Assistant response:
Yes, exactly.

In
$$
A=Q\Lambda Q^T,
$$
the columns of $Q$ are eigenvectors of $A$, and they are orthonormal.

If $Q=[q_1,\dots,q_n]$ and
$$
\Lambda=\mathrm{diag}(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n),
$$
then
$$
Aq_i=\lambda_i q_i
$$
for each $i$.

So each column $q_i$ of $Q$ matches the eigenvalue $\lambda_i$ in the same diagonal position of $\Lambda$.

---

## Response 20

User asked:
> Can you explain the singular value equations and what SVD is doing in the live chat?

Assistant response:
Yes. Here is the clean version.

For $A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$, singular values/vectors satisfy:
$$
Av_i=\sigma_i u_i,\qquad A^Tu_i=\sigma_i v_i,
$$
with $\sigma_i\ge 0$, $v_i\in\mathbb{R}^n$, $u_i\in\mathbb{R}^m$.

Meaning of these equations:
- $v_i$ (right singular vector) is an input direction.
- Applying $A$ sends that direction to output direction $u_i$.
- The scaling factor is exactly $\sigma_i$.
- So $A$ maps $v_i$ to $\sigma_i u_i$.

Why the second equation appears:
- it is the reverse relation through $A^T$.
- it couples the left/right singular vectors into matched pairs.

Equivalent eigenvalue view:
$$
A^TA\,v_i=\sigma_i^2 v_i,\qquad AA^T\,u_i=\sigma_i^2 u_i.
$$
So singular vectors are eigenvectors of $A^TA$ and $AA^T$, with eigenvalue $\sigma_i^2$.

SVD decomposition:
$$
A=U\Sigma V^T,
$$
where
- $V$: orthonormal right singular vectors (input basis),
- $\Sigma$: diagonal (or diagonal-shaped) nonnegative singular values,
- $U$: orthonormal left singular vectors (output basis).

Geometric action of SVD (what it is doing):
1. $V^T$: rotate/change coordinates in input space.
2. $\Sigma$: scale each principal coordinate by $\sigma_i$.
3. $U$: rotate/change coordinates in output space.

So SVD says: every linear map is “rotation/reflection + axis scaling + rotation/reflection”.

Extra useful facts:
- $\sigma_1=\|A\|_2$ (largest singular value = operator norm).
- rank$(A)$ = number of nonzero singular values.
- low-rank approximation keeps largest singular values/vectors.

---

## Response 21

User asked:
> [image] what does the sigma mean here in the sums

Assistant response:
$\sigma_i(A)$ means the $i$-th **singular value** of matrix $A$.

- They are nonnegative numbers from the SVD.
- They are usually ordered:
$$
\sigma_1(A)\ge \sigma_2(A)\ge \cdots \ge 0.
$$
- They satisfy:
$$
\sigma_i(A)=\sqrt{\lambda_i(A^TA)}.
$$

So in those sums, you are summing over singular values:
- nuclear norm: sum of singular values,
$$
\|A\|_{Tr}=\sum_i \sigma_i(A).
$$
- Frobenius norm: square-root of sum of squared singular values,
$$
\|A\|_F=\sqrt{\sum_i \sigma_i^2(A)}.
$$
- Schatten $p$-norm:
$$
\|A\|_{Sch_p}=\left(\sum_i \sigma_i^p(A)\right)^{1/p}.
$$

Small correction to your screenshot:
- for Schatten $p$-norm, the power inside the sum should be $p$, not always $2$.

---

## Response 22

User asked:
> Trace is just the sum of the diagonal entries, right?

Assistant response:
Yes.

For a square matrix $M$:
$$
\mathrm{trace}(M)=\sum_i M_{ii}.
$$

And for square matrices, this also equals the sum of eigenvalues (counting multiplicity).

---

## Response 23

User asked:
> can you start asking some questions on these topics to test my understanding

Assistant response:
Yes. Switching to interactive mode now: one question at a time, quick feedback, then next.

### Q1 (Convex vs Affine Hull)

True or False:
$$
\mathrm{conv}(S)\subseteq \mathrm{Aff}(S).
$$

Answer with just `True` or `False`.

---

## Response 24

User answered:
> Yes, because convex hull over S requires another condition that the weights on each element of S are non-negative, which is not a requirement for affine set.

Assistant response:
Correct.

That is exactly the reason:
- affine combinations require only $\sum_i \theta_i=1$,
- convex combinations require $\sum_i \theta_i=1$ and $\theta_i\ge 0$.

So every convex combination is an affine combination, hence:
$$
\mathrm{conv}(S)\subseteq \mathrm{Aff}(S).
$$

### Q2 (Epigraph)

True or False:
For $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$,
$$
\mathrm{epi}(f)=\{(x,t): t\ge f(x)\}
$$
is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ (not $\mathbb{R}^n$).

Answer with `True` or `False`.

---

## Response 25

User answered:
> Yes, because we're basically adding another dimension to each coordinate.

Assistant response:
Correct.

Equivalent statement:
$$
x\in\mathbb{R}^n,\quad t\in\mathbb{R}
\;\Rightarrow\;
(x,t)\in\mathbb{R}^{n+1}.
$$

So the epigraph lives in one higher-dimensional space.

### Q3 (Normal Cone)

True or False:
If $x$ is an interior point of a convex set $C$, then
$$
N_C(x)=\{0\}.
$$

Answer with `True` or `False`.

---

## Response 26

User answered:
> I'm not sure about this one.

Assistant response:
Good one to pause on. The correct answer is **True**.

Why:
- If $x$ is interior, you can move a little in every direction and stay in $C$.
- If $g\neq 0$, choose direction $d=g$ and a small $y=x+\epsilon d\in C$.
- Then
$$
g^T(y-x)=g^T(\epsilon g)=\epsilon\|g\|^2>0,
$$
which violates the normal-cone condition $g^T(y-x)\le 0$ for all $y\in C$.

So only $g=0$ works:
$$
N_C(x)=\{0\}.
$$

### Q4 (Spectral Radius)

If eigenvalues of $A$ are $\{-3,\ 1,\ 0.2\}$, what is $\rho(A)$?

Answer with a number only.

---

## Response 27

User asked:
> Can you give me the definition of the normal cone?

Assistant response:
Yes.

For a set $C$ and a point $x\in C$, the normal cone is
$$
N_C(x)=\{g\in\mathbb{R}^n:\ g^T(y-x)\le 0,\ \forall y\in C\}.
$$

Intuition:
- $N_C(x)$ contains directions that point outward from $C$ at $x$ (they make non-acute angles with all feasible displacement vectors $y-x$).

---

## Response 28

User asked:
> And so for normal cone, x doesn't have to be in the cone, right? It can be outside the cone. Oh, no, it is inside the cone. So y is also inside the cone. So we have some vector that's like pointing from one point in the cone to another point in the cone. And then we wanna make a, like this GT vector is kind of making an obtuse or right angle with that vector.

Assistant response:
Yes, your final version is the right idea, with one terminology fix:

- $C$ is the original set (it does **not** need to be a cone).
- $x$ must be in $C$.
- $y$ ranges over points in $C$.
- $y-x$ is a feasible displacement from $x$ into the set.
- $g$ is in the **normal cone** $N_C(x)$ if
$$
g^T(y-x)\le 0,\quad \forall y\in C.
$$

So $g$ must make a right/obtuse angle with **every** feasible displacement direction $y-x$.

Small conceptual point:
- $x$ is a point where the normal cone is attached.
- $g$ is a direction/vector in that cone.
- They play different roles.

If this part is clear, we can continue the quiz:
Q4: if eigenvalues are $\{-3,1,0.2\}$, what is $\rho(A)$?

## Response 29

User asked:
> Can you make like a 2D illustration of the normal cone? As a link in the image.

Assistant response:
Yes. Added a new 2D normal-cone illustration.

Open link:
- [normal-cone-2d-illustration.png](../../../materials/archive/local-figures/normal-cone-2d-illustration.png)

Embedded preview:

![2D normal cone illustration](../../../materials/archive/local-figures/normal-cone-2d-illustration.png)

What it shows:
- Green square is the convex set $C=[-1,1]^2$.
- Black point $x=(1,1)$ is a boundary corner.
- Blue arrows are feasible displacement vectors $y-x$ (pointing into $C$).
- Red wedge at $x$ is the normal cone $N_C(x)$.

---

## Response 30

User asked:
> So will X be a member of both the cone and the set C?

Assistant response:
$x$ must be in $C$ (otherwise $N_C(x)$ is not defined).

But $x$ is **not generally** a member of the normal cone $N_C(x)$.

Reason:
- $x$ is the anchor point where the cone is attached.
- elements of $N_C(x)$ are direction vectors $g$.

So conceptually they play different roles, even though both live in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

---

## Response 31

User asked:
> Okay, can we go to the next question? Thank you. This was helpful. The diagram was really good.

Assistant response:
Yes. Moving to the next question.

### Q5 (SVD Basics)

For
$$
A=U\Sigma V^T,
$$
which statement is correct?

A) Columns of $U$ are right singular vectors.  
B) Columns of $V$ are right singular vectors.  
C) Diagonal of $\Sigma$ are eigenvalues of $A$ (always).  
D) Singular values can be negative.

Answer with just `A`, `B`, `C`, or `D`.

---

## Response 32

User answered:
> I think B and C.

Assistant response:
Good reasoning direction. Final answer should be **B only**.

- **B is correct**: columns of $V$ are right singular vectors.
- **C is not always true**: diagonal entries of $\Sigma$ are singular values, not generally eigenvalues of $A$.

Special case:
- if $A$ is symmetric PSD, then eigenvalues are nonnegative and match singular values.
- for a general matrix, they do not.

### Q6 (Spectral Radius quick check)

Answer with a number only.

## Response 33

User asked:
> Wait, can you back up and just like explain SVD a little bit more and like what is a singular vector and what is a singular value and stuff like that?

Assistant response:
Absolutely. Pausing the quiz for a deeper SVD explanation.

### 1) What SVD is

For any matrix $A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$:
$$
A=U\Sigma V^T.
$$

- $V$ (size $n\times n$): orthonormal basis for input space.
- $U$ (size $m\times m$): orthonormal basis for output space.
- $\Sigma$ (size $m\times n$): diagonal-shaped matrix with nonnegative numbers
  $\sigma_1\ge \sigma_2\ge \cdots \ge 0$ on the diagonal.

Those diagonal numbers are the **singular values**.

### 2) Singular vectors and singular values

For each index $i$:
$$
Av_i=\sigma_i u_i,\qquad A^T u_i=\sigma_i v_i.
$$

- $v_i$: right singular vector (column of $V$).
- $u_i$: left singular vector (column of $U$).
- $\sigma_i$: singular value.

Interpretation:
- If you feed input direction $v_i$ into $A$, output points in direction $u_i$.
- The stretch factor is $\sigma_i$.

So singular values are "how much stretching" along special orthogonal directions.

### 3) Geometric picture (most important intuition)

Applying $A$ is equivalent to:
1. rotate/change basis by $V^T$,
2. scale each axis by $\sigma_i$ (via $\Sigma$),
3. rotate/change basis by $U$.

So SVD is: **rotate -> scale -> rotate**.

### 4) Why it is different from eigen-decomposition

- Eigen-decomposition $A=Q\Lambda Q^{-1}$ needs square matrix and may fail to give orthogonal basis for general $A$.
- SVD works for **every** real matrix, including rectangular ones.
- Singular values are always nonnegative.

### 5) Key identities to remember

$$
A^TA\,v_i=\sigma_i^2 v_i,\qquad AA^T\,u_i=\sigma_i^2 u_i.
$$

So:
- right singular vectors = eigenvectors of $A^TA$,
- left singular vectors = eigenvectors of $AA^T$,
- squared singular values = eigenvalues of those matrices.

### 6) Tiny concrete example

Let
$$
A=\begin{bmatrix}3&0\\0&1\end{bmatrix}.
$$
Then:
- right singular vectors are standard basis vectors,
- left singular vectors are also standard basis vectors,
- singular values are $3$ and $1$.

This is pure axis scaling: stretch $x$-axis by $3$, $y$-axis by $1$.
For a general matrix, you just add rotations before/after this scaling.

### 7) Why optimization cares

- $\sigma_1=\|A\|_2$ (operator norm).
- rank$(A)$ = number of nonzero singular values.
- condition/ill-conditioning is reflected in spread of singular values.
- low-rank approximations keep largest singular values (compression/denoising).

If you want, next I can ask 3 quick SVD checks (very short) and then resume Q6.

## Response 34

User asked:
> Sure, let's continue with the SVAD checks.

Assistant response:
Great. Continuing with 3 quick **SVD** checks.

### SVD Check 1

Fill in the blank:

If
$$
A=U\Sigma V^T,
$$
then columns of $V$ are ______ singular vectors, and columns of $U$ are ______ singular vectors.

Answer with two words.

---

## Response 35

User answered:
> Columns of U are left singular vectors and columns of V are right singular vectors.

Assistant response:
Correct.

Exact mapping:
- columns of $V$: right singular vectors,
- columns of $U$: left singular vectors.

### SVD Check 2

True or False:
All singular values of a real matrix are nonnegative.

Answer with `True` or `False`.

---

## Response 36

User answered:
> Yes, I believe this is true.

Assistant response:
Correct: **True**.

Singular values satisfy:
$$
\sigma_i(A)\ge 0.
$$

### SVD Check 3

Fill in the blank:
$$
\|A\|_2=\sigma_{\_\_}(A).
$$

Answer with one symbol/word.

---

## Response 37

User answered:
> I'm not sure about this.

Assistant response:
Good pause. The blank is:
$$
\sigma_{\max}(A)
$$
(equivalently $\sigma_1(A)$ if singular values are ordered descending).

So:
$$
\|A\|_2=\sigma_{\max}(A)=\sigma_1(A).
$$

Nice work through the SVD checks.

Resume quiz flow:
### Q6 (Spectral Radius quick check)
If eigenvalues are $\{-3,\ 1,\ 0.2\}$, what is $\rho(A)$?

Answer with a number only.

---

## Response 38

User answered:
> It would be one.

Assistant response:
Close, but not this one.

Remember:
$$
\rho(A)=\max_i |\lambda_i|.
$$

For eigenvalues $\{-3,\ 1,\ 0.2\}$, magnitudes are $\{3,\ 1,\ 0.2\}$, so
$$
\rho(A)=3.
$$

### Q7 (Quick Trace Check)

If
$$
M=\begin{bmatrix}2&4\\-1&5\end{bmatrix},
$$
what is $\mathrm{trace}(M)$?

Answer with a number only.

---

## Response 39

User answered:
> 7.

Assistant response:
Correct.

$$
\mathrm{trace}(M)=2+5=7.
$$

### Q8 (Convexity Slice Test)

True or False:
If for every $x\in\mathrm{dom}(f)$ and every direction $v$, the 1D slice
$$
g(t)=f(x+tv)
$$
is convex in $t$, then $f$ is convex.

Answer with `True` or `False`.

---

## Response 40

User answered:
> Yes, I believe this is true.

Assistant response:
Correct: **True**.

That is exactly the 1D slice characterization of convexity.

### Q9 (Normal Cone Interior Point)

Fill in the blank:
If $x\in \mathrm{int}(C)$ for convex $C$, then
$$
N_C(x)=\{\_\_\_\}.
$$

Answer with a short expression.

---

## Response 41

User answered:
> I think it's like all of G where GT times Y minus X is less than or equal to zero where Y is in C.

Assistant response:
Good recall of the **general definition**.

But for this specific fill-in (interior point), the result simplifies to:
$$
N_C(x)=\{0\}.
$$

So the blank is just `0`.

### Q10 (One quick SVD check)

True or False:
For any real matrix $A$,
$$
\|A\|_2=\sigma_{\max}(A).
$$

Answer with `True` or `False`.

---

## Response 42

User asked:
> Wait, for the question 9 normal cone, what is um int of c? Is that like interior of c?

Assistant response:
Yes, exactly.

$$
\mathrm{int}(C)
$$
means the **interior** of $C$: points that have a small open ball around them fully inside $C$.

So if $x\in\mathrm{int}(C)$, $x$ is not on the boundary.

That is why the normal cone at an interior point collapses to:
$$
N_C(x)=\{0\}.
$$

If you're ready, continue with Q10:
True or False:
$$
\|A\|_2=\sigma_{\max}(A)
$$
for any real matrix $A$.

---

## Response 43

User asked:
> So the normal cone is only nonzero if we are on the boundary of C?

Assistant response:
For a convex set, yes (with the usual setup).

- If $x\in \mathrm{int}(C)$, then
$$
N_C(x)=\{0\}.
$$
- Nonzero normal directions appear at boundary points.

And if $x\notin C$, the normal cone $N_C(x)$ is not defined in this basic definition.

---

## Response 44

User asked:
> Okay, next question.

Assistant response:
Great. Next one:

### Q10 (SVD / Operator Norm)

True or False:
For any real matrix $A$,
$$
\|A\|_2=\sigma_{\max}(A).
$$

Answer with `True` or `False`.

---

## Response 45

User answered:
> I believe it's less than or equal to that?

Assistant response:
Good instinct, but here it is exact equality.

So Q10 is **True**:
$$
\|A\|_2=\sigma_{\max}(A).
$$

### Q11 (Nuclear vs Frobenius)

Fill in the blank:
$$
\|A\|_{Tr}=\sum_i \sigma_i(A),\qquad
\|A\|_F=\sqrt{\sum_i \sigma_i^{\_\_}(A)}.
$$

Answer with the missing exponent only.

---

## Response 46

User answered:
> I believe nuclear is one and then Frobenius is two.

Assistant response:
Correct.

For Q11, the missing exponent is:
$$
2.
$$

And your summary is right:
- nuclear norm corresponds to Schatten $p=1$,
- Frobenius norm corresponds to Schatten $p=2$.

### Q12 (Spectral Theorem)

True or False:
If $A=A^T$, then $A$ can be written as
$$
A=Q\Lambda Q^T
$$
with $Q$ orthogonal and $\Lambda$ diagonal.

Answer with `True` or `False`.

---

## Response 47

User answered:
> I believe this is true.

Assistant response:
Correct: **True**.

That is the spectral theorem for real symmetric matrices.

### Q13 (Singular Values vs Eigenvalues)

True or False:
For every real matrix $A$, the singular values of $A$ are the square roots of eigenvalues of $A^TA$.

Answer with `True` or `False`.

---

## Response 48

User answered:
> I am not sure.

Assistant response:
Good pause. The answer is **True**.

Reason:
$$
A^TA \text{ is symmetric PSD},
$$
so its eigenvalues are nonnegative, and singular values are defined by
$$
\sigma_i(A)=\sqrt{\lambda_i(A^TA)}.
$$

### Q14 (Quick Geometry Check)

True or False:
At an interior point $x\in\mathrm{int}(C)$, the tangent cone is all of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

Answer with `True` or `False`.

---

## Response 49

User asked:
> Wait, I'm not sure about this one either. Is the tangent cone different from the normal cone?

Assistant response:
Yes, they are different.

- **Tangent cone** $T_C(x)$: feasible local movement directions from $x$.
- **Normal cone** $N_C(x)$: outward blocker directions at $x$.

For convex sets, they are dual via polar:
$$
T_C(x)=N_C(x)^\circ,\qquad N_C(x)=T_C(x)^\circ.
$$

Interior-point behavior:
- $T_C(x)=\mathbb{R}^n$,
- $N_C(x)=\{0\}$.

Boundary-point behavior:
- tangent cone narrows to feasible boundary/inward directions,
- normal cone becomes nonzero outward rays/wedges.

So for Q14, the correct answer is **True**.
