### Turn 1
User asked:
can you also make a live-chat where i can ask questions about the content in the comprehensive notes

Assistant response:
I created a dedicated live-chat transcript for the Exam 2 materials so we can use it for ongoing Q&A and keep the conversation mirrored in markdown.

Use this file for the session:

[topics/optimization-for-ml/lessons/2026-04-14-exam-2-live-chat.md](2026-04-14-exam-2-live-chat.md)

You can start asking questions about any section of the comprehensive notes, and I’ll continue appending both your prompt and my response here.

### Turn 2
User asked:
what is the alpha term in the strongly convex sgd? is that the coefficient for smoothness?

Assistant response:
No. $\alpha$ is the `strong convexity` parameter, not the smoothness parameter.

The usual convention in this course is:

- $\alpha$: strong convexity
- $\beta$: smoothness

So if $f$ is $\alpha$-strongly convex, that means

$$
f(y) \ge f(x) + \nabla f(x)^T(y-x) + \frac{\alpha}{2}\|y-x\|^2
$$

and if $f$ is $\beta$-smooth, that means

$$
f(y) \le f(x) + \nabla f(x)^T(y-x) + \frac{\beta}{2}\|y-x\|^2.
$$

So:

- $\alpha$ gives a lower quadratic curvature bound
- $\beta$ gives an upper quadratic curvature bound

That is why the condition number is

$$
\kappa = \frac{\beta}{\alpha}.
$$

In the strongly convex SGD bound

$$
\mathbb{E}\|x^k-x^*\|^2
\le
(1-\alpha\eta)^k\|x^0-x^*\|^2 + \frac{\eta G^2}{\alpha},
$$

the $\alpha$ appears because stronger curvature pulls iterates back toward the minimizer more aggressively.

### Turn 3
User asked:
in proximal gradient and gradient mapping, does g(x) have to be smooth?

Assistant response:
In the usual proximal-gradient setup, yes: $g$ is the smooth part and $h$ is the possibly nonsmooth part.

The standard split is

$$
f(x)=g(x)+h(x),
$$

where:

- $g$ is differentiable, usually $\beta$-smooth
- $h$ is convex and possibly nonsmooth

That is exactly why the update is

$$
x_{k+1}=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta h}(x_k-\eta \nabla g(x_k)).
$$

If $g$ were not smooth, then the linearization step using $\nabla g(x_k)$ would not be justified in the usual way.

---
### Turn 4
User asked:
i mean does g(x) have to be convex?

Assistant response:
Not always.

In the standard convex-composite setup,

$$
f(x)=g(x)+h(x),
$$

one usually assumes:

- $g$ is smooth and convex
- $h$ is convex and possibly nonsmooth

In that setting, yes, $g$ is convex.

But proximal gradient is also used in nonconvex settings. Then:

- $g$ is still smooth
- $g$ does not have to be convex
- $h$ is still usually proper, closed, and often convex

The update is still

$$
x_{k+1}=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta h}(x_k-\eta \nabla g(x_k)),
$$

and the gradient mapping is still useful, but the guarantee changes. In the convex case, one proves convergence to a global minimizer. In the nonconvex case, one usually only proves convergence to a stationary point or critical point.

So the clean summary is:

- for the standard convex theory from class: yes, $g$ is usually convex
- for proximal gradient as a broader method: no, $g$ does not have to be convex, but it usually still has to be smooth

---
### Turn 5
User asked:
so is the gradient mapping basically just what ends up getting added to the current position? like why is that designated as a special term?

Assistant response:
Yes, essentially.

The proximal-gradient update can be written as

$$
x_{k+1}
=
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta h}(x_k-\eta \nabla g(x_k)).
$$

The gradient mapping is defined by

$$
G_\eta(x_k)
=
\frac{1}{\eta}\left(x_k-\operatorname{prox}_{\eta h}(x_k-\eta \nabla g(x_k))\right).
$$

So rearranging,

$$
x_{k+1}=x_k-\eta G_\eta(x_k).
$$

That means $-\eta G_\eta(x_k)$ is exactly the step that gets added to the current iterate. So your intuition is right.

It is treated as a special object because it plays the role that the ordinary gradient plays in plain gradient descent.

When $h=0$,

$$
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta h}(v)=v,
$$

so

$$
G_\eta(x_k)=\nabla g(x_k),
$$

and the update becomes ordinary gradient descent.

So the point of naming it is:

- it gives one object that summarizes the full composite step
- it reduces to the gradient in the smooth case
- stationarity can be expressed as $G_\eta(x)=0$
- convergence results are often written in terms of $\|G_\eta(x)\|$

So it is not just notation for the step. It is the composite-problem analogue of the gradient, which is why it is important.

---
### Turn 6
User asked:
can you explain the math behind the problem 1.1?

Assistant response:
Yes. The point of Problem 1.1 is to show how a stochastic gradient can come from a single random sample.

The objective is

$$
f(x)=\frac12 \mathbb{E}(X-x)^2.
$$

This means you are trying to choose the scalar $x$ that minimizes the average squared error between $x$ and the random variable $X$.

First expand the square:

$$
(X-x)^2 = X^2 - 2xX + x^2.
$$

So

$$
f(x)=\frac12 \mathbb{E}(X^2-2xX+x^2).
$$

Now use linearity of expectation:

$$
f(x)=\frac12 \left(\mathbb{E}[X^2]-2x\mathbb{E}[X]+x^2\right).
$$

Since $\mu=\mathbb{E}[X]$, this becomes

$$
f(x)=\frac12 \left(\mathbb{E}[X^2]-2x\mu+x^2\right).
$$

Now differentiate with respect to $x$. The term $\mathbb{E}[X^2]$ is a constant, so its derivative is zero. The derivative of $-2x\mu$ is $-2\mu$, and the derivative of $x^2$ is $2x$. Therefore

$$
\nabla f(x)=\frac12(-2\mu+2x)=x-\mu.
$$

That is the true gradient.

Now define the stochastic gradient candidate

$$
g(x;X)=x-X.
$$

This uses one sample of $X$ instead of the unknown mean $\mu$. To check that it is unbiased, take expectation:

$$
\mathbb{E}[g(x;X)\mid x]
=
\mathbb{E}[x-X\mid x]
=
x-\mathbb{E}[X]
=
x-\mu
=
\nabla f(x).
$$

So although $x-X$ is random, its average value is exactly the true gradient.

That is why it is a valid stochastic gradient: each sample gives a noisy estimate of the full gradient, and averaging over the randomness recovers the exact gradient.

Finally, plug it into SGD:

$$
x^{t+1}=x^t-\eta_t g(x^t;X_t)
=
x^t-\eta_t(x^t-X_t)
=
(1-\eta_t)x^t+\eta_t X_t.
$$

This last form is important: it says the new iterate is a weighted average of the old iterate and the new sample.

So the big idea of Problem 1.1 is:

- the full gradient is $x-\mu$
- the sample-based version is $x-X$
- replacing $\mu$ by one random sample gives noise, but not bias
- SGD therefore updates by blending the old estimate with fresh data

---
### Turn 7
User asked:
wait i don't really understand what the question is asking... are we trying to show g() is SGD estimate of f, which we are trying to minimize?

Assistant response:
Almost. The thing to be careful about is:

- $f(x)$ is the objective function we want to minimize
- $\nabla f(x)$ is the true gradient of that objective
- $g(x;X)$ is not an estimate of $f(x)$
- $g(x;X)$ is an estimate of $\nabla f(x)$

So the question is asking you to show that $g(x;X)$ is a valid stochastic gradient for the objective $f(x)$.

More concretely, the problem gives:

$$
f(x)=\frac12 \mathbb{E}(X-x)^2
$$

and defines

$$
g(x;X)=x-X.
$$

Then it asks you to prove that $g$ is an unbiased stochastic gradient. That means you must show

$$
\mathbb{E}[g(x;X)\mid x]=\nabla f(x).
$$

So the logical flow is:

1. compute the true gradient $\nabla f(x)$
2. compute the expectation of the sample-based quantity $g(x;X)$
3. show they are equal

If they are equal, then $g(x;X)$ is exactly the kind of noisy gradient estimate SGD is allowed to use.

So yes, we are minimizing $f$, but the thing we are verifying is that $g$ is a stochastic estimate of the gradient of $f$, not of $f$ itself.

That is why the update uses

$$
x^{t+1}=x^t-\eta_t g(x^t;X_t),
$$

because SGD always plugs in a stochastic gradient estimate where ordinary gradient descent would use the exact gradient.

---
### Turn 8
User asked:
wait so, we're basically trying to learn the true value (or expected value of X), via SGD... and the value we get for the gradient is g(x;X) is x-X? so it's basically saying move in the direction of the recent draw of the random variable X? and the original function f(x) is bascially MSE between the estimate and the RV? and when we plug this into the SGD equation, we get a clear weighted expression that moves the estimate closer to the most recent draw?

Assistant response:
Yes. That is basically the right interpretation.

The clean picture is:

- $x$ is your current estimate
- $X$ is a random draw from the population
- $\mu = \mathbb{E}[X]$ is the true mean
- $f(x)=\frac12 \mathbb{E}(X-x)^2$ is the expected squared error between your estimate and the random variable

So minimizing $f(x)$ means: choose the scalar $x$ that best matches $X$ in mean-squared error. The minimizer turns out to be the mean $\mu$.

The true gradient is

$$
\nabla f(x)=x-\mu.
$$

But you usually do not know $\mu$, so you cannot compute this exact gradient directly. Instead you use one sample $X$, giving the stochastic gradient

$$
g(x;X)=x-X.
$$

This says:

- if your estimate $x$ is larger than the sampled value $X$, then $x-X>0$, so the update moves downward
- if your estimate $x$ is smaller than the sampled value $X$, then $x-X<0$, so the update moves upward

So yes, each SGD step moves the estimate toward the most recent draw.

Plugging into SGD gives

$$
x^{t+1}=x^t-\eta_t(x^t-X_t)
=(1-\eta_t)x^t+\eta_t X_t.
$$

This is the clearest interpretation: the new estimate is a weighted average of

- the old estimate $x^t$
- the new sample $X_t$

So your summary is correct:

- the objective is expected MSE
- the target being learned is the population mean
- the stochastic gradient is sample-based
- the SGD update pulls the estimate toward the latest observation

The only refinement is: the update is not saying the latest draw is the true value. It is saying the latest draw is one noisy piece of information about the true mean, so you move partway toward it.

---
### Turn 9
User asked:
and i guess it's important the function is defined as expectation of X... i guess it wouldn't even make sense to do expectation over x...

Assistant response:
Yes. That is exactly right.

In this setup:

- $X$ is random
- $x$ is the decision variable you control

So the expectation is taken over the randomness in $X$, not over $x$.

The objective

$$
f(x)=\frac12\mathbb{E}(X-x)^2
$$

means:

"for a fixed choice of $x$, what is the average squared loss over random draws of $X$?"

That gives an ordinary deterministic function of $x$ after averaging over the data distribution.

It would not make sense in the same way to take expectation over $x$, because $x$ is not the source of randomness here. It is the parameter you are optimizing.

So the logic is:

1. nature draws $X$
2. you choose $x$
3. loss is $(X-x)^2$
4. the objective is the expected loss over the randomness in $X$

This is the standard statistical-learning setup:

- random data
- deterministic parameter
- optimize expected loss

If $x$ were itself random, then one could talk about expectation over $x$, but that would be a different model. In this problem, $x$ is just the scalar you are trying to learn.

---
### Turn 10
User asked:
in question 1.2, is G the gradient noise? is that just some random term?

Assistant response:
Not exactly.

In the bound

$$
\mathbb{E}\|x^k-x^*\|^2
\le
(1-\alpha \eta)^k\|x^0-x^*\|^2+\frac{\eta G^2}{\alpha},
$$

$G$ is usually a uniform bound on the size of the stochastic gradient, such as

$$
\mathbb{E}\|g(x;\xi)\|^2 \le G^2
$$

or sometimes

$$
\|g(x;\xi)\| \le G
\quad \text{almost surely.}
$$

So $G$ is not "the noise itself." It is a constant that upper-bounds how large the stochastic gradient can be, or how large its second moment can be.

The actual randomness is inside $g(x;\xi)$ or inside the difference

$$
g(x;\xi)-\nabla f(x),
$$

which is the gradient noise.

So:

- $g(x;\xi)$ is the random stochastic gradient
- $g(x;\xi)-\nabla f(x)$ is the noise
- $G$ is a deterministic bound controlling the size of that random quantity

That is why the residual term

$$
\frac{\eta G^2}{\alpha}
$$

acts like a noise floor: if the stochastic gradients can remain large because of randomness, fixed-step SGD cannot collapse all the way to zero error.

---
### Turn 11
User asked:
what does this term mean: $\xi_t$ is that just the learning rate?

Assistant response:
No. $\xi_t$ is the random variable or random sample used to generate the stochastic gradient. It is not the learning rate.

In the SGD update

$$
x^{t+1}=x^t-\eta_t g(x^t;\xi_t),
$$

the roles are:

- $\eta_t$: step size or learning rate
- $\xi_t$: randomness at iteration $t$
- $g(x^t;\xi_t)$: stochastic gradient built from that randomness

So depending on the setting, $\xi_t$ could be:

- a sampled data point
- a sampled example index
- a mini-batch
- additive noise
- a random coordinate

For example, if

$$
f(x)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n f_i(x),
$$

then one common choice is:

- sample $\xi_t \in \{1,\dots,n\}$
- define $g(x;\xi_t)=\nabla f_{\xi_t}(x)$

Then $\xi_t$ simply means "which component did I sample this iteration?"

So the clean distinction is:

- $\eta_t$ controls how large the step is
- $\xi_t$ controls what random information was used to form the step

---
### Turn 12
User asked:
for sgd, how do you get this step:

$$
\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2
=
\|x^t-x^*\|^2
-2\eta g(x^t;\xi_t)^T(x^t-x^*)
+\eta^2\|g(x^t;\xi_t)\|^2
$$

Assistant response:
It comes from substituting the SGD update and then expanding a squared norm.

Start with

$$
x^{t+1}=x^t-\eta g(x^t;\xi_t).
$$

Subtract $x^*$ from both sides:

$$
x^{t+1}-x^* = x^t-\eta g(x^t;\xi_t)-x^*.
$$

Group the terms:

$$
x^{t+1}-x^* = (x^t-x^*)-\eta g(x^t;\xi_t).
$$

Now square the norm:

$$
\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2
=
\|(x^t-x^*)-\eta g(x^t;\xi_t)\|^2.
$$

Use the standard identity

$$
\|a-b\|^2=\|a\|^2-2a^Tb+\|b\|^2.
$$

Here,

$$
a=x^t-x^*,
\qquad
b=\eta g(x^t;\xi_t).
$$

So

$$
\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2
=
\|x^t-x^*\|^2
-2(x^t-x^*)^T(\eta g(x^t;\xi_t))
+\|\eta g(x^t;\xi_t)\|^2.
$$

Now simplify the two terms involving $\eta$:

$$
\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2
=
\|x^t-x^*\|^2
-2\eta g(x^t;\xi_t)^T(x^t-x^*)
+\eta^2\|g(x^t;\xi_t)\|^2.
$$

So this step is just:

1. plug in the update
2. subtract $x^*$
3. expand with $\|a-b\|^2$

---
### Turn 13
User asked:
i need you to walk thought the proof for 1.1 in sgd even slower please... i don't understand the step where we take the conditional expectation... im kinda slow so please walk me through it

Assistant response:
Yes. The conditional-expectation step is the place where SGD proofs usually start to feel slippery, so it is worth slowing it down a lot.

I will use the convex nonsmooth SGD proof structure, because that is where this step first appears clearly.

We start from the expanded recursion

$$
\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2
=
\|x^t-x^*\|^2
-2\eta g(x^t;\xi_t)^T(x^t-x^*)
+\eta^2\|g(x^t;\xi_t)\|^2.
$$

Now ask: at iteration $t$, what is random and what is already fixed?

- $x^t$ is the current iterate
- $x^*$ is the optimizer
- $\eta$ is the stepsize
- $\xi_t$ is the new random draw at this iteration
- so $g(x^t;\xi_t)$ is random because it depends on $\xi_t$

The phrase "take conditional expectation given $x^t$" means:

"Pretend I am standing at iteration $t$ and I already know the current point $x^t$. I now average only over the fresh randomness $\xi_t$."

So when we write

$$
\mathbb{E}[\cdot \mid x^t],
$$

we are treating $x^t$ as fixed inside that expectation.

That means:

$$
\mathbb{E}[\|x^t-x^*\|^2 \mid x^t] = \|x^t-x^*\|^2
$$

because once $x^t$ is known, that quantity is just a number.

Similarly,

$$
\mathbb{E}[\eta^2\|g(x^t;\xi_t)\|^2 \mid x^t]
=
\eta^2 \mathbb{E}[\|g(x^t;\xi_t)\|^2 \mid x^t].
$$

We can pull out $\eta^2$ because it is not random.

Now look at the middle term:

$$
\mathbb{E}\big[g(x^t;\xi_t)^T(x^t-x^*) \mid x^t\big].
$$

Since $x^t-x^*$ is fixed when conditioning on $x^t$, we can pull it outside:

$$
\mathbb{E}\big[g(x^t;\xi_t)^T(x^t-x^*) \mid x^t\big]
=
\mathbb{E}[g(x^t;\xi_t)\mid x^t]^T (x^t-x^*).
$$

This is the key move.

So after taking conditional expectation, the recursion becomes

$$
\mathbb{E}[\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2 \mid x^t]
=
\|x^t-x^*\|^2
-2\eta \,\mathbb{E}[g(x^t;\xi_t)\mid x^t]^T(x^t-x^*)
+\eta^2 \mathbb{E}[\|g(x^t;\xi_t)\|^2\mid x^t].
$$

Now use the two assumptions:

1. unbiasedness / subgradient assumption

$$
g_{x^t}\doteq \mathbb{E}[g(x^t;\xi_t)\mid x^t] \in \partial f(x^t)
$$

2. bounded second moment

$$
\mathbb{E}[\|g(x^t;\xi_t)\|^2\mid x^t] \le G^2.
$$

Substituting those in gives

$$
\mathbb{E}[\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2 \mid x^t]
\le
\|x^t-x^*\|^2
-2\eta g_{x^t}^T(x^t-x^*)
+\eta^2 G^2.
$$

That is all the conditional-expectation step is doing.

The intuition is:

- before conditioning, the next iterate is random because the new stochastic gradient is random
- after conditioning on $x^t$, the only randomness left is the one-step noise $\xi_t$
- averaging over that noise replaces the random gradient by its mean
- that mean is exactly the object we know how to relate to the objective, namely $g_{x^t}$

The reason this step matters is that it converts a random update into something deterministic enough to analyze.

If it helps, here is the whole step in plain English:

1. write the one-step progress formula
2. freeze the current iterate $x^t$
3. average over the fresh random draw $\xi_t$
4. replace the random gradient by its conditional mean
5. use the theorem assumptions on that mean and on the second moment

So the hardest conceptual point is just this:

$$
\mathbb{E}[g(x^t;\xi_t)^T(x^t-x^*)\mid x^t]
=
\mathbb{E}[g(x^t;\xi_t)\mid x^t]^T(x^t-x^*)
$$

because $(x^t-x^*)$ is fixed once you condition on $x^t$.

---
### Turn 14
User asked:
what is the subgradient inequality again?

Assistant response:
For a convex function $f$, if $g \in \partial f(x)$ is a subgradient at $x$, then the subgradient inequality is

$$
f(y) \ge f(x) + g^T(y-x)
\qquad \text{for all } y.
$$

This says that the affine function

$$
f(x) + g^T(y-x)
$$

is a global lower bound on $f(y)$.

Geometrically, it is the nonsmooth analogue of the tangent-line lower-bound property for differentiable convex functions.

If $f$ is differentiable, then the subgradient is just the gradient, so it becomes

$$
f(y) \ge f(x) + \nabla f(x)^T(y-x).
$$

In the SGD proof, we usually use it with

- the current point $x=x^t$
- the comparison point $y=x^*$
- the subgradient $g_{x^t} \in \partial f(x^t)$

Then it becomes

$$
f(x^*) \ge f(x^t) + g_{x^t}^T(x^*-x^t).
$$

Rearranging gives

$$
-g_{x^t}^T(x^t-x^*) \le f(x^*) - f(x^t),
$$

which is exactly the form used in the proof.

---
### Turn 15
User asked:
can you explain step 5 in more detail?

Assistant response:
Yes. I will go slower, and I will use this format:

- original version
- new version
- exact substitution being made

From here on, when we make substitutions in proof explanations, I will format them this way.

Step 4 ended with

$$
\mathbb{E}[\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2\mid x^t]
\le
\|x^t-x^*\|^2
+2\eta(f(x^*)-f(x^t))
+\eta^2 G^2.
$$

Step 5 says: remove the conditioning and then sum over $t$.

## Part A: Remove the conditioning

The idea is that this equation is still conditional on $x^t$. We want an ordinary expectation.

Original version:

$$
\mathbb{E}[\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2\mid x^t]
\le
\|x^t-x^*\|^2
+2\eta(f(x^*)-f(x^t))
+\eta^2 G^2.
$$

New version:

$$
\mathbb{E}\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2
\le
\mathbb{E}\|x^t-x^*\|^2
+2\eta\big(f(x^*)-\mathbb{E}[f(x^t)]\big)
+\eta^2 G^2.
$$

Substitution being made:

- <span style="color:#fca5a5">$\mathbb{E}[\cdot \mid x^t]$ becomes $\mathbb{E}[\cdot]$</span> by taking expectation again
- this uses the tower property

$$
\mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}[Z\mid x^t]]=\mathbb{E}[Z].
$$

So we are not changing the mathematics arbitrarily. We are applying expectation to both sides and using the rule above.

## Part B: Sum the inequality over all iterations

Now take that one-step inequality and write it for every $t=0,1,\dots,k-1$, then add them.

Original version:

$$
\mathbb{E}\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2
\le
\mathbb{E}\|x^t-x^*\|^2
+2\eta\big(f(x^*)-\mathbb{E}[f(x^t)]\big)
+\eta^2 G^2.
$$

New version after summing:

$$
\sum_{t=0}^{k-1}\mathbb{E}\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2
\le
\sum_{t=0}^{k-1}\mathbb{E}\|x^t-x^*\|^2
+2\eta\sum_{t=0}^{k-1}\big(f(x^*)-\mathbb{E}[f(x^t)]\big)
+k\eta^2 G^2.
$$

Substitution being made:

- <span style="color:#86efac">one inequality at time $t$ becomes a sum of inequalities over $t=0,\dots,k-1$</span>

## Part C: Telescope the distance terms

Now focus only on the distance sums.

Original version:

$$
\sum_{t=0}^{k-1}\mathbb{E}\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2
\le
\sum_{t=0}^{k-1}\mathbb{E}\|x^t-x^*\|^2
+2\eta\sum_{t=0}^{k-1}\big(f(x^*)-\mathbb{E}[f(x^t)]\big)
+k\eta^2 G^2.
$$

Move the distance sums to opposite sides:

$$
\sum_{t=0}^{k-1}\mathbb{E}\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2
-\sum_{t=0}^{k-1}\mathbb{E}\|x^t-x^*\|^2
\le
2\eta\sum_{t=0}^{k-1}\big(f(x^*)-\mathbb{E}[f(x^t)]\big)
+k\eta^2 G^2.
$$

Now write out the left-hand side:

$$
\big(\mathbb{E}\|x^1-x^*\|^2+\mathbb{E}\|x^2-x^*\|^2+\cdots+\mathbb{E}\|x^k-x^*\|^2\big)
$$

minus

$$
\big(\mathbb{E}\|x^0-x^*\|^2+\mathbb{E}\|x^1-x^*\|^2+\cdots+\mathbb{E}\|x^{k-1}-x^*\|^2\big).
$$

Everything cancels except the first negative term and the last positive term, so this becomes

$$
\mathbb{E}\|x^k-x^*\|^2-\|x^0-x^*\|^2.
$$

Substitution being made:

- <span style="color:#7dd3fc">the two long sums are replaced by a telescoping difference</span>

That is the whole meaning of "the distance term telescopes."

## Part D: Rearrange to isolate the average suboptimality

After telescoping, we get

$$
\mathbb{E}\|x^k-x^*\|^2-\|x^0-x^*\|^2
\le
2\eta\sum_{t=0}^{k-1}\big(f(x^*)-\mathbb{E}[f(x^t)]\big)
+k\eta^2 G^2.
$$

Rearrange:

$$
2\eta\sum_{t=0}^{k-1}\big(\mathbb{E}[f(x^t)]-f(x^*)\big)
\le
\|x^0-x^*\|^2
+k\eta^2 G^2.
$$

Now divide by $2\eta k$:

$$
\frac{1}{k}\sum_{t=0}^{k-1}\big(\mathbb{E}[f(x^t)]-f(x^*)\big)
\le
\frac{\|x^0-x^*\|^2}{2\eta k}
+\frac{G^2\eta}{2}.
$$

Substitution being made:

- <span style="color:#fcd34d">the summed inequality is converted into an average by dividing by $k$</span>

So the purpose of Step 5 is:

1. turn the one-step bound into a many-step bound
2. make the distance terms collapse by telescoping
3. isolate the average function-value error

Then Step 6 uses convexity to replace the average of $f(x^t)$ by $f(\bar x_k)$.

User asked:
can you explain this line in exam 2 worked problem sgd:
$$
\mathbb{E}_\xi[g(x;\xi)]
=
\mathbb{E}_\xi[\nabla f_\xi(x)]
=
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \nabla f_i(x).
$$

Assistant response:
Yes. The whole point is that $\xi$ is a random index, and it is chosen uniformly from $\{1,\dots,n\}$.

So when you see

$$
g(x;\xi)=\nabla f_\xi(x),
$$

that means:

- if $\xi=1$, then $g(x;\xi)=\nabla f_1(x)$
- if $\xi=2$, then $g(x;\xi)=\nabla f_2(x)$
- ...
- if $\xi=n$, then $g(x;\xi)=\nabla f_n(x)$

So $g(x;\xi)$ is a random variable that takes one of the values

$$
\nabla f_1(x),\nabla f_2(x),\dots,\nabla f_n(x)
$$

with equal probability $\frac{1}{n}$.

That is why

$$
\mathbb{E}_\xi[g(x;\xi)]
=
\mathbb{E}_\xi[\nabla f_\xi(x)]
$$

becomes

$$
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \nabla f_i(x).
$$

It is just the expectation formula for a discrete uniform random variable:

if a random variable takes values $a_1,\dots,a_n$ each with probability $\frac{1}{n}$, then

$$
\mathbb{E}[A]=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n a_i.
$$

Here, the role of $A$ is being played by the random vector $\nabla f_\xi(x)$.

So the line is not doing anything mysterious. It is just saying:

- pick one component gradient uniformly at random
- the expected value of that random pick is the average of all component gradients

And that average is exactly

$$
\nabla f(x)=\nabla\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n f_i(x)\right)
=
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \nabla f_i(x).
$$

So the random single-example gradient is unbiased for the full gradient.

### Turn 18
User asked:
in the proximal gd notes file, you say this:
$$
f(x)+\nabla f(x)^T(z-x)+\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-x\|^2.
$$
If $f$ were differentiable, gradient descent can be motivated as minimizing the local model... can you explain why in the the last term that discusses the distance between $z-x$ shows up when we do gradient descent?

Assistant response:
Yes. That last term is there to regularize the linear approximation.

If you only minimized

$$
f(x)+\nabla f(x)^T(z-x),
$$

then as long as $\nabla f(x)\neq 0$, this problem would usually be unbounded below. You could keep moving farther and farther in the direction $-\nabla f(x)$ and make the linear term decrease without limit.

So we add

$$
\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-x\|^2,
$$

which penalizes moving too far from the current point $x$.

So the model now has two effects:

- the linear term says which direction locally decreases the function
- the quadratic term says do not move arbitrarily far in one step

That makes the subproblem well-defined and gives a finite minimizer.

There is also a second interpretation:

this is like taking a second-order Taylor model, but replacing the Hessian by the simple matrix

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}I.
$$

So instead of using the true local curvature, we use an isotropic quadratic penalty.

Now differentiate the model with respect to $z$:

$$
\nabla f(x)+\frac{1}{\eta}(z-x).
$$

Set this equal to zero:

$$
\nabla f(x)+\frac{1}{\eta}(z-x)=0.
$$

Then

$$
z-x=-\eta \nabla f(x),
$$

so

$$
z=x-\eta \nabla f(x).
$$

That is exactly the gradient-descent update.

So the short answer is:

- the linear term gives the descent direction
- the quadratic distance term keeps the step local and finite
- minimizing that regularized local model produces the GD step

### Turn 19
User asked:
can you add a section somewhere explaining what projected gradient descent is and how it works and what $h = \mathbb{I}_C$ actually means... it was a while ago and im struggling to remember and im struggling to make the connection between proximal gd and that topic

Assistant response:
Yes. The clean way to think about projected gradient descent is:

Suppose you want to solve

$$
\min_{x\in C} g(x),
$$

where $C$ is a convex feasible set.

If there were no constraint, plain GD would take the step

$$
y^{t+1}=x^t-\eta_t \nabla g(x^t).
$$

But that point $y^{t+1}$ might not lie in $C$.

So projected gradient descent does:

1. take the usual gradient step
$$
y^{t+1}=x^t-\eta_t \nabla g(x^t)
$$
2. project that point back onto the feasible set
$$
x^{t+1}=P_C(y^{t+1})
$$

where

$$
P_C(y)=\arg\min_{z\in C}\frac12\|z-y\|^2.
$$

So projection means: among all feasible points, choose the one closest to the unconstrained step.

Now for the proximal-gradient connection.

The indicator function of a set $C$ is

$$
\mathbb{I}_C(x)=
\begin{cases}
0 & x\in C \\
\infty & x\notin C.
\end{cases}
$$

This is just a way to encode the constraint as part of the objective.

Why does it work?

Because minimizing

$$
g(x)+\mathbb{I}_C(x)
$$

is the same as minimizing $g(x)$ subject to $x\in C$:

- inside $C$, the indicator contributes $0$
- outside $C$, it contributes $\infty$

So outside points are automatically forbidden.

Now compute the prox of the indicator:

$$
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,\mathbb{I}_C}(v)
=
\arg\min_z
\left\{
\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-v\|^2+\mathbb{I}_C(z)
\right\}.
$$

Because the indicator is infinite outside $C$, this is the same as

$$
\arg\min_{z\in C}\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-v\|^2,
$$

which is exactly the projection onto $C$.

So

$$
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,\mathbb{I}_C}(v)=P_C(v).
$$

That is why proximal gradient with $h=\mathbb{I}_C$ becomes

$$
x^{t+1}
=
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,\mathbb{I}_C}(x^t-\eta \nabla g(x^t))
=
P_C(x^t-\eta \nabla g(x^t)),
$$

which is exactly projected gradient descent.

So the bridge is:

- projected GD is the special case of prox-GD where the nonsmooth term is a hard constraint indicator
- prox-GD generalizes projection from sets to more general structured penalties

### Turn 20
User asked:
in the case where h = I_C, is h basically infinity whenever the input is not in the set C, and 0 when it is in the set C?

Assistant response:
Yes. That is exactly what the indicator function means:

$$
\mathbb{I}_C(x)=
\begin{cases}
0 & x\in C \\
\infty & x\notin C.
\end{cases}
$$

So:

- if $x$ is feasible, the indicator adds nothing
- if $x$ is outside the set, the objective becomes infinite

This is just a mathematical way to turn a constrained problem

$$
\min_{x\in C} g(x)
$$

into an unconstrained-looking problem

$$
\min_x g(x)+\mathbb{I}_C(x).
$$

Because any point outside $C$ gets value $\infty$, it can never be optimal.

So yes:

- inside $C$: cost $0$
- outside $C$: cost $\infty$

That is why the prox of $\mathbb{I}_C$ becomes projection onto $C$.

### Turn 21
User asked:
in this part: If $g$ is $\beta$-smooth and $\eta\le 1/\beta$, then

$$
g(z)\le g(x)+\nabla g(x)^T(z-x)+\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-x\|^2.
$$

So the quadratic model

$$
\hat g_\eta(z)
=
g(x)+\nabla g(x)^T(z-x)+\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-x\|^2
$$

is an upper bound on $g(z)$ that is tight at $z=x$.

Therefore
what does tight mean? also, is the first line just from the definition of B-smooth?

Assistant response:
Yes, with one small nuance.

For a $\beta$-smooth function, the standard smoothness inequality is

$$
g(z)\le g(x)+\nabla g(x)^T(z-x)+\frac{\beta}{2}\|z-x\|^2.
$$

That is the usual consequence of $\beta$-smoothness.

The line in the notes uses

$$
\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-x\|^2
$$

instead of

$$
\frac{\beta}{2}\|z-x\|^2.
$$

Why is that allowed?

Because if

$$
\eta \le \frac{1}{\beta},
$$

then

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}\ge \beta,
$$

so

$$
\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-x\|^2 \ge \frac{\beta}{2}\|z-x\|^2.
$$

So the $\frac{1}{2\eta}$ version is a looser but still valid upper bound.

So the answer is:

- the first line is not the raw definition of $\beta$-smoothness by itself
- it comes from the usual smoothness upper bound plus the extra assumption $\eta\le 1/\beta$

Now for "tight at $z=x$":

it means the upper bound matches the true function at that point.

If you plug in $z=x$, then

$$
\hat g_\eta(x)
=
g(x)+\nabla g(x)^T(x-x)+\frac{1}{2\eta}\|x-x\|^2
=
g(x).
$$

So at the current point, the upper bound and the true function have the same value.

That is what "tight" means here: the upper bound touches the function at the current iterate.

In fact, it is even better than just matching the value:

- the values match at $z=x$
- the first-order term is also matched there

So the model is a locally accurate upper approximation of $g$ around the current point.

---
### Turn 22
User asked:
how do we know it's tight at that point?

Assistant response:
Because we can directly plug in $z=x$.

The model is

$$
\hat g_\eta(z)
=
g(x)+\nabla g(x)^T(z-x)+\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-x\|^2.
$$

Now evaluate it at $z=x$:

$$
\hat g_\eta(x)
=
g(x)+\nabla g(x)^T(x-x)+\frac{1}{2\eta}\|x-x\|^2.
$$

But

$$
x-x=0,
$$

so both extra terms disappear:

$$
\nabla g(x)^T(x-x)=0,
\qquad
\frac{1}{2\eta}\|x-x\|^2=0.
$$

Therefore

$$
\hat g_\eta(x)=g(x).
$$

That is exactly what "tight at $x$" means: the upper bound and the true function have the same value at that point.

### Turn 23
User asked:
The lecture introduces the generalized gradient

$$
G_\eta(x)
=
\frac{1}{\eta}
\left(
x-\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x-\eta \nabla g(x))
\right).
$$

This lets us write the update in gradient-descent form:

$$
x^{t+1}=x^t-\eta_t G_{\eta_t}(x^t).
$$

can you go deeper on this? expand the expression

Assistant response:
Yes. The best way to understand it is to introduce the two points that are hidden inside the formula.

Start with the raw gradient step for the smooth part:

$$
v := x-\eta \nabla g(x).
$$

This is the point you would move to if you ignored $h$ completely.

Now apply the prox correction:

$$
y := \operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(v).
$$

This is the actual next point after accounting for the nonsmooth part $h$.

So the gradient mapping is

$$
G_\eta(x)=\frac{1}{\eta}(x-y).
$$

That already gives the first interpretation:

- $x-y$ is the actual displacement from the current point to the prox-updated point
- dividing by $\eta$ turns that displacement into a gradient-like object

That is why the update can be written as

$$
y=x-\eta G_\eta(x).
$$

Now let us expand the difference $x-y$ by inserting the intermediate point $v$:

$$
x-y = (x-v)+(v-y).
$$

Substitute $v=x-\eta \nabla g(x)$:

$$
x-v = x-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))=\eta \nabla g(x).
$$

So

$$
x-y=\eta \nabla g(x)+(v-y).
$$

Now divide by $\eta$:

$$
G_\eta(x)
=
\nabla g(x)+\frac{1}{\eta}(v-y).
$$

Finally replace $v$ and $y$ by their definitions:

$$
G_\eta(x)
=
\nabla g(x)
+
\frac{1}{\eta}
\left(
x-\eta \nabla g(x)
-
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x-\eta \nabla g(x))
\right).
$$

This is the key expansion.

It says:

- one part of $G_\eta(x)$ is the usual smooth gradient $\nabla g(x)$
- the other part is the correction created by the prox step

That correction is not arbitrary. By prox optimality, if

$$
y=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(v),
$$

then

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}(v-y)\in \partial h(y).
$$

So the expansion becomes

$$
G_\eta(x)\in \nabla g(x)+\partial h(y),
\qquad
y=x-\eta G_\eta(x).
$$

This is why the gradient mapping is the right generalized gradient:

- it contains the smooth gradient of $g$
- it contains a valid subgradient contribution from $h$, but evaluated at the prox point

That last detail is important: it is not generally true that

$$
G_\eta(x)\in \nabla g(x)+\partial h(x).
$$

Instead,

$$
G_\eta(x)\in \nabla g(x)+\partial h(x-\eta G_\eta(x)).
$$

So the subgradient part is attached to the updated point, not the original one.

That is exactly why the proofs have to be written carefully.

You can also interpret the whole update geometrically:

1. start at $x$
2. make the raw smooth step to
$$
v=x-\eta \nabla g(x)
$$
3. the prox pulls that point to a new point
$$
y=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(v)
$$
4. the vector from $x$ to $y$ is the actual descent step
5. $G_\eta(x)$ is just that actual step, normalized by $1/\eta$

So in one line:

$$
G_\eta(x)
=
\text{smooth gradient part}
+
\text{prox correction part}.
$$

### Turn 24
User asked:
are the descent lemmas here super complicated to show... if not can we expand them in the notes section?

Assistant response:
They are not too bad once you know the proximal optimality condition. The whole proof comes from one key fact:

if
$$
u=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(v),
$$
then
$$
\frac{1}{\eta}(v-u)\in \partial h(u).
$$

For the case $g=0$, the update is
$$
x^{t+1}=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x^t),
$$
so this becomes
$$
\frac{1}{\eta}(x^t-x^{t+1})\in \partial h(x^{t+1}).
$$

But when $g=0$, the gradient mapping is
$$
G_\eta(x^t)=\frac{1}{\eta}(x^t-x^{t+1}),
$$
so really
$$
G_\eta(x^t)\in \partial h(x^{t+1}).
$$

That is the main trick. The gradient mapping becomes a genuine subgradient of $h$ at the new point.

Then use the subgradient inequality: if $s\in \partial h(y)$, then for every $z$,
$$
h(y)\le h(z)-s^T(z-y).
$$

Now plug in
$$
y=x^{t+1},
\qquad
s=G_\eta(x^t).
$$

This gives
$$
h(x^{t+1})\le h(z)-G_\eta(x^t)^T(z-x^{t+1}).
$$

From here, both lemmas are just substitutions.

For the first lemma, choose $z=x^t$:
$$
h(x^{t+1})\le h(x^t)-G_\eta(x^t)^T(x^t-x^{t+1}).
$$

Now substitute
$$
x^t-x^{t+1}=\eta G_\eta(x^t),
$$
which gives
$$
h(x^{t+1})\le h(x^t)-\eta \|G_\eta(x^t)\|^2.
$$

For the second lemma, choose $z=x^*$:
$$
h(x^{t+1})\le h(x^*)-G_\eta(x^t)^T(x^*-x^{t+1}).
$$

Then expand
$$
x^*-x^{t+1}=(x^*-x^t)+(x^t-x^{t+1}),
$$
and substitute
$$
x^t-x^{t+1}=\eta G_\eta(x^t).
$$

That gives
$$
h(x^{t+1})
\le
h(x^*)
-\eta \|G_\eta(x^t)\|^2
+
G_\eta(x^t)^T(x^t-x^*).
$$

So the proof is not long. The only real idea is:

- proximal optimality gives a subgradient at the new point
- the subgradient inequality converts that into descent
- the identity $x^t-x^{t+1}=\eta G_\eta(x^t)$ turns the remaining term into a squared norm

I also expanded this directly in the proximal-gradient notes section so the note itself now walks through the proof step by step.

### Turn 25
User asked:
why do we know that the function here is convex: By definition,

$$
u=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(v)
$$

means that $u$ minimizes

$$
\psi(z)=\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-v\|^2+h(z).
$$

Since $\psi$ is convex, first-order optimality says

Assistant response:
Because in the standard proximal-gradient setup from class, $h$ is assumed to be convex.

So in
$$
\psi(z)=\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-v\|^2+h(z),
$$
both pieces are convex:

- the quadratic term
$$
\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-v\|^2
$$
is convex in $z$ and in fact strongly convex
- $h(z)$ is convex by assumption

And the sum of two convex functions is convex. So $\psi$ is convex.

More explicitly:

1. The map $z \mapsto z-v$ is affine.
2. The map $w \mapsto \|w\|^2$ is convex.
3. Multiplying by the positive constant $\frac{1}{2\eta}$ preserves convexity.
4. Adding the convex function $h$ preserves convexity.

So that is why the notes can say $\psi$ is convex.

There is also a stronger fact: because the quadratic term is strongly convex, $\psi$ is actually strongly convex, so the minimizer $u$ is unique.

One more important correction: since $h$ may be nonsmooth, “first-order optimality” here really means **subgradient optimality**, not ordinary differentiability. So the correct statement is
$$
0\in \partial \psi(u).
$$

Then compute the subgradient of $\psi$:
$$
\partial \psi(u)=\frac{1}{\eta}(u-v)+\partial h(u),
$$
because the quadratic part is differentiable and its gradient is
$$
\nabla_u \frac{1}{2\eta}\|u-v\|^2=\frac{1}{\eta}(u-v).
$$

So
$$
0\in \frac{1}{\eta}(u-v)+\partial h(u),
$$
which is equivalent to
$$
\frac{1}{\eta}(v-u)\in \partial h(u).
$$

That is the proximal optimality condition used in the proof.

So the short answer is:

- we know $\psi$ is convex because the quadratic term is convex and $h$ is assumed convex
- if $h$ were not convex, then this argument would no longer be automatically valid

### Turn 26
User asked:
can you also expand on proof 2.5.2 in the notes doc

Assistant response:
I expanded `2.5.2 Contraction / Nonexpansiveness` directly in the proximal-gradient notes.

The proof is not hard, but it goes quickly unless you break it into pieces. The structure is:

1. define
$$
u=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x),
\qquad
v=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(y)
$$
2. use proximal optimality at both points:
$$
\frac{1}{\eta}(x-u)\in \partial h(u),
\qquad
\frac{1}{\eta}(y-v)\in \partial h(v)
$$
3. use monotonicity of the subdifferential:
$$
\langle s_u-s_v,u-v\rangle \ge 0
$$
4. substitute the two prox subgradients
5. regroup
$$
(x-u)-(y-v)=(x-y)-(u-v)
$$
6. expand the inner product to get
$$
\langle x-y,u-v\rangle-\|u-v\|^2\ge 0
$$
7. rearrange:
$$
\|u-v\|^2\le \langle x-y,u-v\rangle
$$

That is the stronger inequality, often called **firm nonexpansiveness**.

Then apply Cauchy-Schwarz:
$$
\langle x-y,u-v\rangle \le \|x-y\|\,\|u-v\|,
$$
which gives
$$
\|u-v\|^2\le \|x-y\|\,\|u-v\|.
$$

If $u\neq v$, divide by $\|u-v\|$. If $u=v$, the result is automatic. So:
$$
\|u-v\|\le \|x-y\|.
$$

So the flow is:

- prox optimality
- monotonicity
- algebra
- Cauchy-Schwarz

I also rewrote it in the notes with explicit numbered steps and substitution lines so it is easier to follow later.

can you add some more detailed explanation between these steps in the prox gd text:

$$
g(y)\le g(x)-\eta \nabla g(x)^T G_\eta(x)+\frac{\beta \eta^2}{2}\|G_\eta(x)\|^2.
$$

Now use convexity of $g$:

$$
g(x)\le g(z)+\nabla g(x)^T(x-z).
$$

So

$$
g(y)\le g(z)+\nabla g(x)^T(x-z)-\eta \nabla g(x)^T G_\eta(x)+\frac{\beta \eta^2}{2}\|G_\eta(x)\|^2.
$$

Assistant response:
Yes. The missing move is that we are replacing the $g(x)$ term in the first inequality by an upper bound coming from convexity.

We start with
$$
g(y)\le g(x)-\eta \nabla g(x)^T G_\eta(x)+\frac{\beta \eta^2}{2}\|G_\eta(x)\|^2.
$$

Then convexity gives
$$
g(x)\le g(z)+\nabla g(x)^T(x-z).
$$

This is the first-order convexity inequality at the point $x$, compared against the arbitrary point $z$.

Now the reason we can combine them is the general logic:

if
$$
A\le B+C
$$
and
$$
B\le D,
$$
then
$$
A\le D+C.
$$

Here,
$$
A=g(y),
\qquad
B=g(x),
$$
and
$$
C=-\eta \nabla g(x)^T G_\eta(x)+\frac{\beta \eta^2}{2}\|G_\eta(x)\|^2,
$$
while
$$
D=g(z)+\nabla g(x)^T(x-z).
$$

So we substitute

- original version:
$$
g(y)\le g(x)-\eta \nabla g(x)^T G_\eta(x)+\frac{\beta \eta^2}{2}\|G_\eta(x)\|^2
$$
- new ingredient:
$$
g(x)\le g(z)+\nabla g(x)^T(x-z)
$$
- substitution being made:
$$
g(x)\mapsto g(z)+\nabla g(x)^T(x-z)
$$

After that substitution, we get
$$
g(y)\le g(z)+\nabla g(x)^T(x-z)-\eta \nabla g(x)^T G_\eta(x)+\frac{\beta \eta^2}{2}\|G_\eta(x)\|^2.
$$

So conceptually, this step is just:

- smoothness gave a bound in terms of $g(x)$
- convexity lets us replace $g(x)$ by something involving the comparison point $z$
- that prepares the $g$-part of the proof so it can later be combined with the $h$-part

I also inserted this slower bridge directly into the proximal-gradient notes.

$$
\min_z \frac{1}{2\eta}(z-v)^2+\lambda |z|.
$$

Now split into cases.

If $z>0$, then $|z|=z$, so minimize

$$
\frac{1}{2\eta}(z-v)^2+\lambda z.
$$

Differentiate:

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}(z-v)+\lambda=0
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
z=v-\eta\lambda.
$$

This is only valid in the case $z>0$, so it works when

$$
v>\eta\lambda.
$$

If $z<0$, then $|z|=-z$, so minimize

$$
\frac{1}{2\eta}(z-v)^2-\lambda z.
$$

Differentiate:

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}(z-v)-\lambda=0
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
z=v+\eta\lambda.
$$

This is only valid when

$$
v<-\eta\lambda.
$$

If $|v|\le \eta\lambda$, then neither positive nor negative candidate is valid, and the minimizer is

$$
z=0.
$$

So the prox "shrinks" toward zero by the amount $\eta\lambda$, and if the magnitude is small enough, it gets thresholded all the way to zero.

That is why this is called soft-thresholding.

### Turn 29
User asked:
in the worked example for problem 2.2, how do we know the part regarding: this is valid only if v > n: Setting this to zero gives

$$
z=v-\eta.
$$

This is valid only if $v>\eta$.
that seems to come from out of nowhere?

Assistant response:
It comes from the **case assumption** we started with.

In that part of the derivation, we explicitly said:

$$
\text{assume } z>0.
$$

Under that assumption, we replaced $|z|$ by $z$ and solved the smooth problem. That gave the critical point

$$
z=v-\eta.
$$

But once we get that candidate, we still have to check whether it actually belongs to the case we assumed.

So we impose:

- original case assumption:
$$
z>0
$$
- candidate:
$$
z=v-\eta
$$
- substitution being made:
$$
v-\eta>0
$$

which is equivalent to

$$
v>\eta.
$$

So the point is not that $v>\eta$ came from nowhere. It came from checking consistency with the original case assumption $z>0$.

The same thing happens in the negative case:

- assume $z<0$
- solve and get
$$
z=v+\eta
$$
- then require
$$
v+\eta<0
\iff
v<-\eta.
$$

So the logic is always:

1. assume a sign for $z$
2. solve under that assumption
3. check whether the solution actually satisfies the assumed sign

I also added this clarification directly into the worked-problems note.

### Turn 30
User asked:
and where does the logic that if |v| <= n, the minimizer is z = 0? like where does that come from

Assistant response:
Assuming you mean $|v|\le \eta$, that middle case comes from the fact that we already handled the positive and negative branches, so the only possibility left is the point $z=0$.

The prox problem is

$$
\min_z \phi(z)
\qquad\text{where}\qquad
\phi(z)=\frac{1}{2\eta}(z-v)^2+|z|.
$$

We split into three cases because $|z|$ is piecewise:

1. $z>0$
2. $z<0$
3. $z=0$

From the first two cases we found:

- if $z>0$, the critical point is
$$
z=v-\eta,
$$
and this is valid only when
$$
v>\eta.
$$

- if $z<0$, the critical point is
$$
z=v+\eta,
$$
and this is valid only when
$$
v<-\eta.
$$

So if neither $v>\eta$ nor $v<-\eta$ is true, then we must be in the remaining regime

$$
-\eta \le v \le \eta,
$$

which is exactly

$$
|v|\le \eta.
$$

That tells you the positive and negative candidates are not valid. So the minimizer has to occur at the kink:

$$
z=0.
$$

If you want the more formal check, look at the slope on each side of $0$.

For $z>0$,

$$
\phi'(z)=\frac{1}{\eta}(z-v)+1,
$$

so at the right side of zero,

$$
\phi'(0^+)=1-\frac{v}{\eta}.
$$

This is nonnegative when

$$
v\le \eta.
$$

For $z<0$,

$$
\phi'(z)=\frac{1}{\eta}(z-v)-1,
$$

so at the left side of zero,

$$
\phi'(0^-)= -\frac{v}{\eta}-1.
$$

This is nonpositive when

$$
v\ge -\eta.
$$

So when

$$
|v|\le \eta,
$$

the function is decreasing as you move toward $0$ from the left, and increasing as you move away from $0$ to the right. That means $0$ is the minimizer.

### Turn 31
User asked:
note that h(x) = infinity if we're not in the set C... so the proximal operator essentially finds the closest point z to v that is in the feasible set C, where closest is defined by euclidian distance... so after computing the gradient, we get x_{t+1} = \pi_c ((1-n)x_t - n), where pi_c is the projection operator onto feasible set C... note that this is exactly projected gradient descent, where we first take a plain gradient descent step, then project it to the closest corresponding point on the feasible set...

Assistant response:
Yes, that is the right interpretation.

If

$$
h(x)=\mathbb{I}_C(x),
$$

then

$$
h(x)=
\begin{cases}
0, & x \in C, \\
\infty, & x \notin C.
\end{cases}
$$

So in the proximal problem

$$
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(v)
=
\arg\min_z \frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-v\|^2 + \mathbb{I}_C(z),
$$

any point outside $C$ is disallowed because it has infinite objective value. That means the problem is equivalent to

$$
\arg\min_{z \in C} \frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-v\|^2.
$$

Since $\frac{1}{2\eta}$ is just a positive constant, it does not change the minimizer, so this is the same as

$$
\arg\min_{z \in C} \|z-v\|^2.
$$

That is exactly Euclidean projection onto $C$:

$$
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,\mathbb{I}_C}(v)=\Pi_C(v).
$$

So yes: the prox operator is just finding the feasible point closest to $v$ in Euclidean distance.

For the example

$$
g(x)=\frac12(x+1)^2,
$$

we have

$$
\nabla g(x)=x+1.
$$

So the raw gradient step is

$$
x_t-\eta \nabla g(x_t)
=
x_t-\eta(x_t+1)
=
(1-\eta)x_t-\eta.
$$

Then applying the prox gives

$$
x_{t+1}
=
\Pi_C\bigl((1-\eta)x_t-\eta\bigr).
$$

So the only notation correction is that this should use $\eta$, not $n$.

And yes, this is exactly projected gradient descent:

1. take an ordinary gradient step on the smooth objective
2. project back onto the feasible set

So proximal gradient descent contains projected gradient descent as the special case where the nonsmooth term is just the indicator of a constraint set.

### Turn 32
User asked:
this is for problem 2.3 btw

worked problem 2.3

Assistant response:
Yes, and I folded that explanation directly into worked problem 2.3.

The key interpretation now written there is:

$$
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,\mathbb{I}_C}(v)
=
\arg\min_{z \in C} \frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-v\|^2,
$$

so the prox is just finding the feasible point closest to $v$ in Euclidean distance.

For that worked problem specifically, the update is written as

$$
x_{t+1}
=
\Pi_C\bigl(x_t-\eta \nabla g(x_t)\bigr)
=
\Pi_C\bigl((1-\eta)x_t-\eta\bigr),
$$

which makes the projected-gradient interpretation explicit.

### Turn 33
User asked:
so overall correct (except for the n notation term)?

Assistant response:
Yes. The logic is correct.

The only fix was the notation: it should be $\eta$, not $n$.

So the cleaned-up version is:

$$
h(x)=\mathbb{I}_C(x)
=
\begin{cases}
0, & x \in C, \\
\infty, & x \notin C,
\end{cases}
$$

which means the proximal operator keeps only feasible points and chooses the one closest to $v$ in Euclidean distance:

$$
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,\mathbb{I}_C}(v)
=
\Pi_C(v).
$$

Then proximal gradient becomes

$$
x_{t+1}
=
\Pi_C\bigl(x_t-\eta \nabla g(x_t)\bigr).
$$

For problem 2.3 specifically, since

$$
\nabla g(x)=x+1,
$$

this becomes

$$
x_{t+1}
=
\Pi_C\bigl((1-\eta)x_t-\eta\bigr).
$$

So yes: conceptually correct, with only the $\eta$ notation needing correction.

### Turn 34
User asked:
/Users/saahith/Downloads/IMG_7407\ 2.HEIC does this look roughly correct to you for problme 2.4?

Assistant response:
Yes, the main idea is correct.

You are doing the right proof:

1. start from the fixed-point assumption
$$
x=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x-\eta \nabla g(x))
$$
2. rewrite the prox definition as an optimization problem
3. apply the optimality condition
4. substitute the fixed-point relation
5. simplify to get
$$
0 \in \nabla g(x)+\partial h(x)
$$

That is exactly the right structure.

The main correction is this:

- do **not** write an ordinary derivative of the whole objective, because $h$ may be nonsmooth
- instead use the **subgradient optimality condition**

So the clean version is:

Let

$$
v=x-\eta \nabla g(x).
$$

Since

$$
x=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(v),
$$

the proximal optimality condition gives

$$
0 \in \frac{1}{\eta}(x-v)+\partial h(x).
$$

Now substitute

$$
v=x-\eta \nabla g(x):
$$

$$
0 \in \frac{1}{\eta}\bigl(x-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))\bigr)+\partial h(x).
$$

Simplify:

$$
0 \in \frac{1}{\eta}\bigl(\eta \nabla g(x)\bigr)+\partial h(x)
=
\nabla g(x)+\partial h(x).
$$

So: roughly correct, yes. The key fix is replacing any line like $\phi'(z)=0$ with a subgradient statement like

$$
0 \in \partial \phi(z).
$$

Also, write

$$
0 \in \nabla g(x)+\partial h(x),
$$

not $0 \subset \nabla g(x)+\partial h(x)$.

### Turn 35
User asked:
ok, so even though i didn't explictly say i was using the subgradient optimality condition, i kind of did by saying that 0 is in the set ...

Assistant response:
Yes, basically.

If you wrote something of the form

$$
0 \in \frac{1}{\eta}(x-v)+\partial h(x),
$$

or

$$
0 \in \nabla g(x)+\partial h(x),
$$

then you were already using subgradient optimality in substance.

That notation means:

- there exists some subgradient in $\partial h(x)$
- which makes the whole expression equal to zero

So conceptually, yes, that is the subgradient optimality condition.

The only real issue is to make the logic clean:

1. first define the prox objective
2. then say the minimizer satisfies
$$
0 \in \partial \phi(x)
$$
3. then expand that subdifferential to get
$$
0 \in \frac{1}{\eta}(x-v)+\partial h(x)
$$
4. then substitute $v=x-\eta \nabla g(x)$

So your reasoning was basically right. It just helps to name that step explicitly so the grader can see you are invoking the correct optimality condition for a possibly nonsmooth function.

### Turn 36
User asked:
in problem 4.2, what are stationarity points?

is it just points where gradient of lagrangian equals zero?

it's in the worked problems section btw

Assistant response:
For **that specific problem 4.2**, there are **no constraints**, so the stationary points are just the points where the derivative of the objective is zero.

The problem is

$$
\max_x -x^4+x^2.
$$

So here you are just solving

$$
f'(x)=0.
$$

That gives the stationary points.

In general:

- **unconstrained problem**: stationary point means
$$
\nabla f(x)=0
$$
- **constrained KKT problem**: stationarity means
$$
\nabla_x L(x,\lambda,\nu)=0
$$
or, in the nonsmooth case, the corresponding subgradient version

So yes, in KKT settings it is the gradient of the **Lagrangian** that gets set to zero. But in worked problem 4.2 there is no constraint and no Lagrangian term to add, so “stationary point” just means a critical point of the original objective.

---
### Turn 37
User asked:
so in a convex problem, first-order stationarity implies that it is optimal?

Assistant response:
Yes, for an **unconstrained convex problem**, first-order stationarity is enough for global optimality.

If $f$ is convex and differentiable, then

$$
\nabla f(x)=0
$$

implies that $x$ is a global minimizer.

The reason is the first-order convexity inequality:

$$
f(y)\ge f(x)+\nabla f(x)^T(y-x)
\qquad \text{for all } y.
$$

If $\nabla f(x)=0$, this becomes

$$
f(y)\ge f(x)
\qquad \text{for all } y,
$$

which is exactly global optimality.

For a nonsmooth convex function, the right analogue is

$$
0 \in \partial f(x),
$$

and that also implies global optimality.

The important caveat is the **constrained** case. There, stationarity by itself is not enough. You also need feasibility, and in KKT form usually complementary slackness and dual feasibility as well.

So the clean summary is:

- unconstrained convex: yes, stationarity implies global optimality
- nonsmooth convex: yes, if $0 \in \partial f(x)$
- constrained convex: not stationarity alone; you need the full KKT conditions

### Turn 38
User asked:
which question in the exam is this referring to: This problem is intentionally exam-style. On Exam 1, several points were lost by stating only a rate and not the quantity that converges. SGD is exactly the kind of section where that mistake is easy to make.(this is in worked-problems-section-01-sgd

Assistant response:
The closest **Exam 1** references are the rate questions:

- Question 5 in the select-all section:
$$
\text{smooth convex GD rate}
$$
- Question 7 in the select-all section:
$$
\text{subgradient method rate}
$$

Those are in:

- [materials/processed/optimization-for-ml/submission_393376523.md](../../../materials/processed/optimization-for-ml/submission_393376523.md)

More specifically:

- Exam 1, Question 5 asked for the convergence rate for smooth convex GD and explicitly said the rate was with respect to **function values**
- Exam 1, Question 7 asked for the subgradient-method rate and explicitly said the rate was with respect to
$$
|f(x^{best})-f(x^*)|
$$

So those are the closest exam-style references.

But the phrase in the worked-problem note is actually a little stronger than the evidence. The more direct places where this exact mistake showed up are:

- Quiz 2, Question 5:
  it explicitly said “be precise about the quantity that is converging — the rate alone is not sufficient”
- Quiz 3, Question 2:
  the prox-GD rate answer mixed up the rate with the controlled quantity

So the most accurate version is:

- **Exam 1** supports the idea that rate questions are stated carefully with a specific quantity
- **Quiz 2 / Quiz 3** are the more direct evidence that this was an actual weakness worth drilling

If you want, I can edit that sentence in the SGD worked problems so it says this more accurately.

### Turn 39
User asked:
can you expand upon this in the worked problems section a bit more: Now take expectation over the random mini-batch. Because the batch is formed by uniform sampling with replacement,

$$
\mathbb{E}[g(w;B_t)]
=
\frac{1}{b}\sum_{\ell=1}^b \mathbb{E}[\nabla f_{\xi_\ell}(w)]
=
\frac{1}{b}\sum_{\ell=1}^b \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \nabla f_i(w)
=
\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \nabla f_i(w)
=
\nabla f(w).
$$

So the mini-batch gradient is unbiased.

Assistant response:
Yes. The key is to name the random indices and separate two facts:

1. each sampled index is uniform over $\{1,\dots,N\}$
2. expectation of an average is the average of expectations

Write the mini-batch as

$$
B_t=(\xi_1,\dots,\xi_b),
$$

where each

$$
\xi_\ell
$$

is sampled uniformly from

$$
\{1,\dots,N\}
$$

with replacement.

So for any fixed batch position $\ell$,

$$
\nabla f_{\xi_\ell}(w)
$$

is a random vector that equals

$$
\nabla f_1(w),\dots,\nabla f_N(w)
$$

each with probability

$$
\frac{1}{N}.
$$

That is why

$$
\mathbb{E}[\nabla f_{\xi_\ell}(w)]
=
\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \nabla f_i(w).
$$

Now start from the definition of the mini-batch gradient:

$$
g(w;B_t)=\frac{1}{b}\sum_{\ell=1}^b \nabla f_{\xi_\ell}(w).
$$

Take expectation:

$$
\mathbb{E}[g(w;B_t)]
=
\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{1}{b}\sum_{\ell=1}^b \nabla f_{\xi_\ell}(w)\right].
$$

Use linearity of expectation:

$$
\mathbb{E}[g(w;B_t)]
=
\frac{1}{b}\sum_{\ell=1}^b \mathbb{E}[\nabla f_{\xi_\ell}(w)].
$$

Now substitute the uniform-average formula for each term:

$$
\mathbb{E}[g(w;B_t)]
=
\frac{1}{b}\sum_{\ell=1}^b \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \nabla f_i(w).
$$

The inner term does not depend on $\ell$, so it is just the same quantity repeated $b$ times and divided by $b$:

$$
\frac{1}{b}\sum_{\ell=1}^b \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \nabla f_i(w)
=
\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \nabla f_i(w).
$$

Finally, since

$$
f(w)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N f_i(w),
$$

we have

$$
\nabla f(w)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \nabla f_i(w).
$$

So

$$
\mathbb{E}[g(w;B_t)]=\nabla f(w),
$$

which is exactly what it means for the mini-batch gradient to be unbiased.

I also expanded this directly in the SGD worked-problems note.

### Turn 40
User asked:
can you expand on this sequence of steps?

$$
\frac{1}{b}\sum_{\ell=1}^b \mathbb{E}[\nabla f_{\xi_\ell}(w)]
$$
- use that each sampled index is uniform:
$$
\frac{1}{b}\sum_{\ell=1}^b \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \nabla f_i(w)
$$

Assistant response:
Yes. The missing step is: for each fixed batch position $\ell$, the random index

$$
\xi_\ell
$$

is uniform on

$$
\{1,\dots,N\}.
$$

So

$$
\mathbb{P}(\xi_\ell=i)=\frac{1}{N}
\qquad \text{for each } i.
$$

That means the random vector

$$
\nabla f_{\xi_\ell}(w)
$$

equals

$$
\nabla f_1(w),\dots,\nabla f_N(w)
$$

with equal probabilities. Therefore its expectation is

$$
\mathbb{E}[\nabla f_{\xi_\ell}(w)]
=
\sum_{i=1}^N \mathbb{P}(\xi_\ell=i)\,\nabla f_i(w)
=
\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{N}\nabla f_i(w)
=
\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \nabla f_i(w).
$$

Now plug that back into the outer average:

$$
\frac{1}{b}\sum_{\ell=1}^b \mathbb{E}[\nabla f_{\xi_\ell}(w)]
=
\frac{1}{b}\sum_{\ell=1}^b \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \nabla f_i(w).
$$

So nothing mysterious is happening there. You are just replacing each expectation

$$
\mathbb{E}[\nabla f_{\xi_\ell}(w)]
$$

by its explicit uniform-average formula.

I also inserted this exact middle step into the SGD worked-problems note.

### Turn 41
User asked:
can you walk through this problem a bit more slowly please: ### Problem 1.8

Suppose the strongly convex SGD proof gives the recursion

Assistant response:
Yes. The whole point of Problem 1.8 is to see what “unrolling the recursion” actually means.

Start from

$$
a_{t+1}\le (1-\alpha \eta)a_t+\eta^2 G^2.
$$

To make the notation lighter, define

$$
\rho = 1-\alpha \eta.
$$

Then the recursion is

$$
a_{t+1}\le \rho a_t+\eta^2 G^2.
$$

You should read this as:

- take the previous error $a_t$
- shrink it by the factor $\rho$
- then add a fresh noise term $\eta^2 G^2$

Now write the recursion at the last few times.

At time $k-1$:

$$
a_k\le \rho a_{k-1}+\eta^2 G^2.
$$

At time $k-2$:

$$
a_{k-1}\le \rho a_{k-2}+\eta^2 G^2.
$$

Now substitute the second line into the first.

- original version:
$$
a_k\le \rho a_{k-1}+\eta^2 G^2
$$
- new version for $a_{k-1}$:
$$
a_{k-1}\le \rho a_{k-2}+\eta^2 G^2
$$
- substitution:
$$
a_k\le \rho(\rho a_{k-2}+\eta^2 G^2)+\eta^2 G^2
$$

Expand:

$$
a_k\le \rho^2 a_{k-2}+\rho \eta^2 G^2+\eta^2 G^2
=
\rho^2 a_{k-2}+\eta^2 G^2(1+\rho).
$$

Do it one more time:

$$
a_{k-2}\le \rho a_{k-3}+\eta^2 G^2.
$$

Substitute again:

$$
a_k
\le
\rho^2(\rho a_{k-3}+\eta^2 G^2)+\eta^2 G^2(1+\rho)
=
\rho^3 a_{k-3}+\eta^2 G^2(\rho^2+\rho+1).
$$

Now the pattern is visible:

$$
a_k
\le
\rho^m a_{k-m}+\eta^2 G^2(1+\rho+\rho^2+\cdots+\rho^{m-1}).
$$

If you keep going all the way back to the start, then $m=k$, so

$$
a_k
\le
\rho^k a_0+\eta^2 G^2(1+\rho+\rho^2+\cdots+\rho^{k-1}).
$$

That sum is geometric:

$$
1+\rho+\rho^2+\cdots+\rho^{k-1}
=
\frac{1-\rho^k}{1-\rho}.
$$

Now replace $\rho$ by $1-\alpha \eta$:

$$
1-\rho = 1-(1-\alpha \eta)=\alpha \eta.
$$

So

$$
1+\rho+\rho^2+\cdots+\rho^{k-1}
=
\frac{1-(1-\alpha \eta)^k}{\alpha \eta}.
$$

Plug that back in:

$$
a_k
\le
(1-\alpha \eta)^k a_0
+
\eta^2 G^2 \cdot \frac{1-(1-\alpha \eta)^k}{\alpha \eta}.
$$

Simplify the coefficient:

$$
\eta^2 G^2 \cdot \frac{1}{\alpha \eta}
=
\frac{\eta G^2}{\alpha}.
$$

So

$$
a_k
\le
(1-\alpha \eta)^k a_0
+
\frac{\eta G^2}{\alpha}\bigl(1-(1-\alpha \eta)^k\bigr).
$$

And since

$$
1-(1-\alpha \eta)^k \le 1,
$$

you get the clean bound

$$
a_k
\le
(1-\alpha \eta)^k a_0+\frac{\eta G^2}{\alpha}.
$$

Interpretation:

- the first term is the part of the error coming from the initialization, and it shrinks geometrically
- the second term is the persistent stochastic floor

So fixed-step strongly convex SGD keeps contracting, but not all the way to zero.

I also rewrote Problem 1.8 in the SGD worked-problems note with this slower version.

### Turn 42
User asked:
1. yes? 2. it's full (regular GD), cuz as you increase b you also increase the time for one gradient step

this is for problem 1.11

sorry 1.11

Assistant response:
For Problem 1.11:

1. **Yes.**

The mini-batch gradient is unbiased for every batch size $b$ as long as the batch is sampled uniformly.

2. **Mostly yes, but with one important caveat.**

If by $b=N$ you mean:

- take the full dataset once and average all $N$ component gradients,

then yes, that is full-batch gradient descent.

But in **HW3**, the batch was sampled **with replacement**. So even when

$$
b=N,
$$

the batch can still contain repeated examples and miss others. In that case the update is **not exactly** the full gradient on that particular step; it is still an unbiased estimator of the full gradient, just with much lower variance than a small batch.

3. Your wall-clock intuition is correct.

The reason larger $b$ does not automatically win in practice is:

- bigger batch $\Rightarrow$ lower variance
- but also bigger batch $\Rightarrow$ more computation per update

So the tradeoff is not just iteration quality, but iteration cost.

I also corrected Problem 1.11 in the SGD worked-problems note so it now distinguishes:

- exact full-dataset gradient
- size-$N$ sampling with replacement

### Turn 43
User asked:
can you epxlain this in more detail: ### Problem 1.10

In the convex SGD proof, justify the step

$$
\mathbb{E}\bigl[g(x^t;\xi_t)^T(x^t-x^*) \mid x^t\bigr]
=
\mathbb{E}[g(x^t;\xi_t)\mid x^t]^T(x^t-x^*).
$$

Why is this valid?

### Solution

Once we condition on $x^t$, the vector

$$
x^t-x^*
$$

is no longer random. The only remaining randomness is in $\xi_t$, and therefore in

$$
g(x^t;\xi_t).
$$

So this is just the rule that fixed vectors can be pulled out of conditional expectation:

$$
\mathbb{E}[a(\xi)^T b \mid x^t]
=
\mathbb{E}[a(\xi)\mid x^t]^T b
$$

whenever $b$ is fixed given $x^t$.

Here:

- original version:
$$
\mathbb{E}\bigl[g(x^t;\xi_t)^T(x^t-x^*) \mid x^t\bigr]
$$
- fixed term:
$$
x^t-x^*
$$
- new version:
$$
\mathbb{E}[g(x^t;\xi_t)\mid x^t]^T(x^t-x^*)
$$

This is a small step, but it is one of the most common places to get stuck in SGD proofs.

Assistant response:
Yes. The key is that once you condition on

$$
x^t,
$$

the vector

$$
x^t-x^*
$$

is treated like a constant.

So the expression has the form:

- random vector:
$$
g(x^t;\xi_t)
$$
- fixed vector:
$$
x^t-x^*
$$

and you are taking the expectation of their dot product.

Here is the same step in coordinates.

Let

$$
b=x^t-x^*.
$$

Because we are conditioning on $x^t$, this vector $b$ is fixed. Write

$$
b=(b_1,\dots,b_d).
$$

Also write

$$
g(x^t;\xi_t)=(g_1,\dots,g_d).
$$

Then

$$
g(x^t;\xi_t)^T(x^t-x^*)
=
\sum_{j=1}^d g_j b_j.
$$

Now take conditional expectation:

$$
\mathbb{E}\bigl[g(x^t;\xi_t)^T(x^t-x^*) \mid x^t\bigr]
=
\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{j=1}^d g_j b_j \,\middle|\, x^t\right].
$$

Since each

$$
b_j
$$

is fixed given $x^t$, you can pull it out:

$$
\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{j=1}^d g_j b_j \,\middle|\, x^t\right]
=
\sum_{j=1}^d b_j\,\mathbb{E}[g_j\mid x^t].
$$

Now rewrite that as a dot product again:

$$
\sum_{j=1}^d b_j\,\mathbb{E}[g_j\mid x^t]
=
\mathbb{E}[g(x^t;\xi_t)\mid x^t]^T(x^t-x^*).
$$

So the rule is the same as the scalar fact

$$
\mathbb{E}[cZ]=c\,\mathbb{E}[Z]
$$

when $c$ is constant. Here the “constant” is the vector

$$
x^t-x^*,
$$

and it appears inside an inner product.

The right mental model is:

- before conditioning, the stochastic gradient is random
- after conditioning on $x^t$, the current iterate is frozen
- so $x^t-x^*$ behaves like a constant vector
- only $g(x^t;\xi_t)$ is still random

I also expanded Problem 1.10 directly in the SGD worked-problems note.

### Turn 44
User asked:
ok so basically, even though x_t - x* depends on x_t, since we are fixing x_t, it basically beocmes a constant...

Assistant response:
Yes. That is exactly the right idea.

The important distinction is:

- before conditioning, $x^t-x^*$ may be random because $x^t$ itself depends on the earlier stochastic updates
- after conditioning on $x^t$, you are treating the current iterate as known

So once you write

$$
\mathbb{E}[\cdot \mid x^t],
$$

the vector

$$
x^t-x^*
$$

is fixed for the purpose of that expectation. It can still *depend* on $x^t$, but that is fine, because $x^t$ is exactly what you are conditioning on.

So in short:

- depends on $x^t$: yes
- random after conditioning on $x^t$: no

That is why it can be pulled out of the conditional expectation.

User asked:
in problem 2.6, what is I_[0, inf]? g(x)=\frac12(x+1)^2,
\qquad
h(x)=\mathbb{I}_{[0,\infty)}(x),
\qquad
\eta=\frac12.

Assistant response:
It is the **indicator function** of the set

$$
[0,\infty).
$$

So

$$
\mathbb{I}_{[0,\infty)}(x)
=
\begin{cases}
0, & x \ge 0,\\
\infty, & x<0.
\end{cases}
$$

It does **not** mean the identity function. It is a way of encoding the hard constraint

$$
x \ge 0
$$

inside the objective.

So in this problem:

- if $x$ is feasible, then $h(x)=0$
- if $x$ is infeasible, then $h(x)=\infty$

That is why the prox of this $h$ becomes projection onto the set $[0,\infty)$:

$$ 
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(v)=\Pi_{[0,\infty)}(v)=\max(v,0).
$$

User asked:
can you expand on this proof in a bit more detail: ### 5.4.1 Why the PSD inner product is nonnegative

This fact gets used so often that it is worth seeing why it is true.

Suppose

$$
A \succeq 0,
\qquad
B \succeq 0.
$$

Because $A$ is PSD, it has a symmetric square root $A^{1/2}$. Then

$$
A \bullet B
=
\operatorname{Tr}(AB).
$$

Insert the square root:

$$
\operatorname{Tr}(AB)
=
\operatorname{Tr}(A^{1/2}BA^{1/2}).
$$

Now the matrix

$$
A^{1/2}BA^{1/2}
$$

is also PSD, because for any vector $v$,

$$
v^T A^{1/2}BA^{1/2} v
=
(A^{1/2}v)^T B (A^{1/2}v)
\ge 0.
$$

A PSD matrix has nonnegative eigenvalues, so its trace is nonnegative. Therefore

$$
\operatorname{Tr}(A^{1/2}BA^{1/2}) \ge 0.
$$

So

$$
A \bullet B \ge 0.
$$

This is exactly the step that makes the SDP weak-duality gap nonnegative.

Assistant response:
Yes. The proof is short once you know it, but there are really five separate moves hidden inside it.

Start from the definition:

$$
A \bullet B=\operatorname{Tr}(A^T B).
$$

Since $A$ is symmetric,

$$
A^T=A,
$$

so

$$
A \bullet B=\operatorname{Tr}(AB).
$$

Now use the fact that a PSD matrix has a symmetric square root:

$$
A=A^{1/2}A^{1/2}.
$$

So

$$
\operatorname{Tr}(AB)
=
\operatorname{Tr}(A^{1/2}A^{1/2}B).
$$

Next use the cyclic property of trace:

$$
\operatorname{Tr}(XYZ)=\operatorname{Tr}(ZXY).
$$

This lets you rotate the factors:

$$
\operatorname{Tr}(A^{1/2}A^{1/2}B)
=
\operatorname{Tr}(BA^{1/2}A^{1/2})
=
\operatorname{Tr}(A^{1/2}BA^{1/2}).
$$

So

$$
A \bullet B
=
\operatorname{Tr}(A^{1/2}BA^{1/2}).
$$

Now define

$$
C:=A^{1/2}BA^{1/2}.
$$

We want to show $C$ is PSD. Take any vector $v$:

$$
v^T C v
=
v^T A^{1/2}BA^{1/2}v
=
(A^{1/2}v)^T B (A^{1/2}v).
$$

Set

$$
w=A^{1/2}v.
$$

Then

$$
v^T C v = w^T B w.
$$

Because $B \succeq 0$, we know

$$
w^T B w \ge 0
\qquad \text{for every } w.
$$

So

$$
v^T C v \ge 0
\qquad \text{for every } v,
$$

which means

$$
C \succeq 0.
$$

Now use the fact that a PSD matrix has nonnegative trace. You can see that either from:

1. nonnegative eigenvalues, with trace equal to their sum, or
2. nonnegative diagonal entries, with trace equal to their sum

So

$$
\operatorname{Tr}(C)\ge 0.
$$

Substitute back

$$
C=A^{1/2}BA^{1/2},
$$

to get

$$
\operatorname{Tr}(A^{1/2}BA^{1/2})\ge 0.
$$

And since that quantity equals $A \bullet B$, we conclude

$$
A \bullet B \ge 0.
$$

So the proof structure is:

1. rewrite as a trace
2. insert the square root
3. use cyclicity of trace
4. prove the middle matrix is PSD
5. use “PSD implies nonnegative trace”

I also expanded this directly in the SDP notes section.

### Turn 46
User asked:
can you explain the logic behind the generalized gradient update? G_\eta(x)
=
\frac{1}{\eta}(x-x^+)
=
2\left(x-\max\left(\frac{x-1}{2},0\right)\right). so G is the vector pointing from the post-prox point to the pre-prox point? and we subtract this vector to descend?

Assistant response:
Almost. The important distinction is:

- $x$ = the **current point**
- $v=x-\eta \nabla g(x)$ = the **raw gradient step before prox**
- $x^+=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(v)$ = the **actual next point after prox**

The generalized gradient is defined by

$$
G_\eta(x)=\frac{1}{\eta}(x-x^+).
$$

So it is **not** the vector from the post-prox point to the pre-prox point $v$.

It is the scaled vector from the **new point** $x^+$ back to the **current point** $x$.

Equivalently,

$$
x^+=x-\eta G_\eta(x).
$$

That is why it plays the role of a gradient: the update has exactly the same form as gradient descent,

$$
\text{new point} = \text{current point} - \eta \times \text{gradient-like object}.
$$

So:

- $x-x^+$ points from the new point back to the old point
- $x^+-x$ is the actual step you take
- the actual step is
$$
x^+-x=-\eta G_\eta(x)
$$

So yes, we subtract $\eta G_\eta(x)$ to descend.

For Problem 2.6 specifically, since

$$
\eta=\frac12,
$$

we have

$$
G_\eta(x)=2(x-x^+).
$$

That factor of $2$ is just because dividing by $\eta=\frac12$ means multiplying by $2$.

The geometric picture is:

1. start at $x$
2. take the raw smooth step to
$$
v=x-\eta \nabla g(x)
$$
3. apply the prox / projection to get
$$
x^+
$$
4. define $G_\eta(x)$ so that the final update can still be written as
$$
x^+=x-\eta G_\eta(x)
$$

So the generalized gradient is the object that makes the composite update look like ordinary gradient descent again.

### Turn 48
User asked:
i've never seen the square root of the matrix trick... can you expand on that a little bit?

Assistant response:
Yes. The key point is that for a PSD matrix $A$, there is another symmetric matrix called $A^{1/2}$ such that

$$
A^{1/2}A^{1/2}=A.
$$

This is **not** taking square roots entry-by-entry. It is a matrix factorization.

The clean way to see why it exists is spectral decomposition. Since $A \succeq 0$ and is symmetric, we can write

$$
A=Q\Lambda Q^T,
$$

where

- $Q$ is orthogonal
- $\Lambda=\operatorname{diag}(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n)$
- each $\lambda_i \ge 0$

Because the eigenvalues are nonnegative, we can take their ordinary square roots and define

$$
\Lambda^{1/2}=\operatorname{diag}(\sqrt{\lambda_1},\dots,\sqrt{\lambda_n}).
$$

Then define

$$
A^{1/2}=Q\Lambda^{1/2}Q^T.
$$

Now check:

$$
A^{1/2}A^{1/2}
=
Q\Lambda^{1/2}Q^T Q\Lambda^{1/2}Q^T
=
Q\Lambda Q^T
=
A.
$$

So that is the matrix square root.

Why this is useful in the SDP proof:

If you want to prove

$$
A \bullet B \ge 0
$$

for $A,B \succeq 0$, the hard part is that

$$
AB
$$

need not itself be PSD.

So instead of working directly with $AB$, you rewrite things using the square root of $A$:

$$
A \bullet B
=
\operatorname{Tr}(AB)
=
\operatorname{Tr}(A^{1/2}BA^{1/2}).
$$

Now the middle matrix

$$
A^{1/2}BA^{1/2}
$$

**is** PSD, because for any vector $v$,

$$
v^T A^{1/2}BA^{1/2}v
=
(A^{1/2}v)^T B (A^{1/2}v)
\ge 0.
$$

So the square-root trick is really a way of turning $A$ into a “left half” and a “right half” around $B$, which makes the PSD structure visible.

You can think of it as the matrix analogue of writing a scalar nonnegative number as

$$
a=(\sqrt{a})(\sqrt{a}).
$$

For positive definite matrices, this is closely related to Cholesky factorization. For PSD matrices, the symmetric square root is the cleanest conceptual version for proofs.

### Turn 49
User asked:
can you expand the part about sum of squares (hw 4 connection). go more in depth on it please

Assistant response:
Yes. I expanded the HW4 / SOS part directly in the SDP comprehensive notes.

The new version now goes through:

1. what “sum of squares” actually means
2. why every SOS polynomial gives a PSD Gram matrix
3. why every PSD Gram-matrix representation gives an SOS decomposition back
4. the quartic case from HW4 in detail
5. why coefficient-matching turns the problem into an SDP

The key equivalence is

$$
p(x)\text{ is SOS}
\iff
\exists Q \succeq 0 \text{ such that } p(x)=[x]_d^T Q [x]_d.
$$

And for the quartic case, the note now explicitly expands

$$
[x]_2^T Q [x]_2
$$

and derives the linear coefficient constraints

$$
q_{00}=r_0,\quad
2q_{01}=r_1,\quad
q_{11}+2q_{02}=r_2,\quad
2q_{12}=r_3,\quad
q_{22}=r_4.
$$

So the note now makes the SDP modeling step much more explicit:

- PSD constraint on $Q$
- linear equalities on the entries of $Q$
- therefore an SDP feasibility problem

Assistant response:
Yes. That is correct.

If

$$
X=

2 & 1 \\
1 & 2
\end{pmatrix},
\qquad
x=

x_1 \\

then first compute

$$
Xx=
\begin{pmatrix}
2x_1+x_2 \\
x_1+2x_2
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

Now multiply on the left by

$$
x^T=(x_1,x_2).
$$

So

$$
x^T X x
=
(x_1,x_2)
\begin{pmatrix}
2x_1+x_2 \\
x_1+2x_2
\end{pmatrix}
=
x_1(2x_1+x_2)+x_2(x_1+2x_2).
$$

Expanding gives

$$
x^T X x
=
2x_1^2+2x_1x_2+2x_2^2.
$$

So your expression is right.

The next useful rewrite is

$$
2x_1^2+2x_1x_2+2x_2^2
=
(x_1+x_2)^2+x_1^2+x_2^2,
$$

which makes the nonnegativity obvious.

### Turn 51
User asked:
for the SOS problem, what is an SDP feasibility problem exactly? cuz, we're not exactly minimizing a constraint here, right?

Assistant response:
Right. In an SDP feasibility problem, you are not really trying to optimize anything. You are just asking:

$$
\text{Does there exist a variable that satisfies all the SDP constraints?}
$$

So the word “feasibility” means:

- no meaningful objective
- only constraints
- the goal is to find one feasible point, or determine that none exists

For the SOS question, the variable is the Gram matrix $Q$. The question is:

$$
\text{Does there exist a symmetric matrix } Q \succeq 0
$$

such that the coefficient-matching equations hold?

That is why this is an SDP feasibility problem.

More concretely, for a quartic polynomial you are asking whether there exists a matrix

$$
Q \succeq 0
$$

with entries satisfying linear equations like

$$
q_{11}=r_0,\qquad
2q_{12}=r_1,\qquad
2q_{13}+q_{22}=r_2,\qquad
2q_{23}=r_3,\qquad
q_{33}=r_4.
$$

There is no real minimization target there. You are just checking existence.

If you want, you can force it into optimization form by writing

$$
\min 0
\quad \text{subject to the SDP constraints,}
$$

but that objective is meaningless. It is just a standard way to package a feasibility question as an optimization problem.

So your instinct is right:

- ordinary SDP optimization: optimize a linear function over PSD and linear constraints
- SDP feasibility: just ask whether the PSD and linear constraints can be satisfied at all

### Turn 54
User asked:
in the newton's methods notes, can you explain this: At iteration $k$, linearize the gradient around $x_k$:

$$
\nabla f(x_k+\Delta x)
\approx
\nabla f(x_k)+\nabla^2 f(x_k)\Delta x.
$$

Assistant response:
Yes. The clean way to read this is:

`we do not know the gradient at the next point yet, so we approximate it using a first-order Taylor expansion around the current point.`

Start by defining a new function

$$
g(x)=\nabla f(x).
$$

Now $g$ is a vector-valued function.

The ordinary first-order Taylor rule says:

$$
g(x_k+h)\approx g(x_k)+J_g(x_k)h,
$$

where $J_g(x_k)$ is the Jacobian of $g$ at $x_k$.

But here

$$
g(x)=\nabla f(x),
$$

so the Jacobian of $g$ is exactly the Hessian of $f$:

$$
J_g(x_k)=\nabla^2 f(x_k).
$$

Now rename the small step $h$ as

$$
h=\Delta x.
$$

That gives

$$
\nabla f(x_k+\Delta x)
\approx
\nabla f(x_k)+\nabla^2 f(x_k)\Delta x.
$$

So this line is just:

- take the gradient function
- do a first-order Taylor expansion around $x_k$
- the derivative of the gradient is the Hessian

The reason Newton does this is that we want the next point to satisfy

$$
\nabla f(x_{k+1})=0.
$$

If we write

$$
x_{k+1}=x_k+\Delta x,
$$

then the exact equation would be

$$
\nabla f(x_k+\Delta x)=0.
$$

But that is still nonlinear and hard to solve.

So Newton replaces it by the linearized equation

$$
\nabla f(x_k)+\nabla^2 f(x_k)\Delta x=0.
$$

That is now a linear system in the unknown step $\Delta x$.

Solving it gives

$$
\Delta x=-[\nabla^2 f(x_k)]^{-1}\nabla f(x_k).
$$

If it helps, the one-dimensional version is easier to see:

$$
f'(x_k+\Delta x)\approx f'(x_k)+f''(x_k)\Delta x.
$$

So the multidimensional formula is the same idea, just with:

- gradient instead of derivative
- Hessian matrix instead of second derivative

The most important intuition is:

`Newton approximates the gradient near the current point by an affine function, then chooses the step that would make that approximation equal to zero.`

### Turn 55
User asked:
for problem 7.1, could you explain why we square the norm term here:

$$
\mathcal{L}(w,\lambda)=E[(w^T z)^4]-3+\lambda(\|w\|^2-1).
$$

Assistant response:
Yes. The main reason is:

`the actual constraint is that w should have unit length, and ||w|| = 1 is equivalent to ||w||^2 = 1.`

So we are not changing the feasible set. We are just writing the same unit-norm constraint in a form that is easier to differentiate.

Why is it easier?

Because

$$
\nabla_w \|w\|^2 = 2w,
$$

which is very clean.

If instead you wrote the constraint as

$$
\|w\|-1=0,
$$

then the derivative of $\|w\|$ is more awkward:

$$
\nabla_w \|w\| = \frac{w}{\|w\|}.
$$

That is much less convenient algebraically.

So the squared norm is mostly a convenience choice:

- same constraint set
- cleaner derivative
- simpler stationarity equation

There is also an ICA-specific reason this form is natural.

After whitening, you usually have

$$
E[zz^T]=I.
$$

Then the variance of the scalar projection $w^T z$ is

$$
E[(w^T z)^2]
=
w^T E[zz^T] w
=
w^T I w
=
\|w\|^2.
$$

So requiring unit variance for the projection is exactly the condition

$$
\|w\|^2=1.
$$

That means the squared norm is not just mathematically convenient. In ICA it also matches the natural variance normalization after whitening.

So the short answer is:

- $\|w\|=1$ and $\|w\|^2=1$ describe the same unit sphere
- $\|w\|^2$ is easier to differentiate
- in whitened ICA, $\|w\|^2$ is also the variance of $w^T z$

### Turn 56
User asked:
can you explain this rewriting in problem 5.4?

Assistant response:
Yes. The key rewrite in Problem 5.4 is

$$
e_i^T X e_i
+ 2t\, e_i^T X e_j
+ t^2 e_j^T X e_j
\ge 0
$$

becoming

$$
X_{ii}+2tX_{ij}+t^2 X_{jj}\ge 0.
$$

That is just using what standard basis vectors do to a matrix.

The rule to remember is:

$$
e_a^T X e_b = X_{ab}.
$$

Why?

- multiplying by $e_b$ on the right picks out column $b$
- then multiplying by $e_a^T$ on the left picks out row $a$
- so the result is exactly the $(a,b)$ entry

So in this problem:

- original version:

$$
e_i^T X e_i
$$

- new version:

$$
X_{ii}
$$

because it picks out the $(i,i)$ entry.

Then:

- original version:

$$
e_i^T X e_j
$$

- new version:

$$
X_{ij}
$$

because it picks out the $(i,j)$ entry.

And:

- original version:

$$
e_j^T X e_j
$$

- new version:

$$
X_{jj}.
$$

So the whole quadratic expression

$$
e_i^T X e_i
+ 2t\, e_i^T X e_j
+ t^2 e_j^T X e_j
$$

just becomes

$$
X_{ii}+2tX_{ij}+t^2X_{jj}.
$$

If it helps, you can think of $e_i$ as “select row/column $i$.”

### Turn 58
User asked:
how do they get the term $2t e_i^T X e_j$... I get two terms like that, but one has i first and one has j first

Assistant response:
Yes. If you expand it fully, you do get two cross terms first.

Start with

$$
(e_i+t e_j)^T X (e_i+t e_j).
$$

First rewrite the left factor:

$$
(e_i+t e_j)^T = e_i^T + t e_j^T.
$$

So now the expression is

$$
(e_i^T+t e_j^T)X(e_i+t e_j).
$$

Now distribute carefully. You get four terms:

$$
e_i^T X e_i
+ t e_i^T X e_j
+ t e_j^T X e_i
+ t^2 e_j^T X e_j.
$$

So your expansion is right: there are two cross terms.

The reason the worked solution combines them is that $X$ is PSD, and PSD matrices are symmetric. So

$$
X^T = X.
$$

Now look at one of the cross terms:

$$
e_j^T X e_i.
$$

This is a scalar. Since it is a scalar, it equals its own transpose:

$$
e_j^T X e_i = (e_j^T X e_i)^T.
$$

Take the transpose:

$$
(e_j^T X e_i)^T = e_i^T X^T e_j.
$$

Because $X^T=X$, this becomes

$$
e_i^T X e_j.
$$

So the two cross terms are equal:

$$
t e_i^T X e_j + t e_j^T X e_i
=
t e_i^T X e_j + t e_i^T X e_j
=
2t e_i^T X e_j.
$$

So the full expansion becomes

$$
e_i^T X e_i
+ 2t e_i^T X e_j
+ t^2 e_j^T X e_j.
$$

The key reason this works is symmetry. If $X$ were not symmetric, you would keep the two cross terms separate.

`/Users/saahith/Downloads/IMG_0403.HEIC here are my answers to the true/false... for question 1.11, i think it's true? but kinda shaky on the details there...`

Assistant response:
For $1.11$, the correct answer is **False**.

The statement was:

$$
\text{In AdamW, adding } L_2 \text{ regularization to the objective is exactly the same as decoupled weight decay inside Adam.}
$$

It is false because there are two different mechanisms:

1. Add $L_2$ regularization to the objective.
   Then the gradient becomes
   $$
   \nabla f(w) + \lambda w.
   $$
   In Adam, that whole quantity gets fed into the adaptive machinery, so the shrinkage term $\lambda w$ is also scaled coordinatewise by the Adam denominator.

2. Use decoupled weight decay, as in AdamW.
   Then you do the Adam-style gradient step, and separately apply a shrinkage term directly to the weights. The decay is not mixed into the adaptive gradient normalization in the same way.

So the key difference is:

- with plain $L_2$ regularization inside Adam, the regularization term is blended into the adaptively scaled gradient
- with AdamW, the weight decay is applied separately

That is why they are not exactly equivalent.

A useful contrast is:

- for vanilla SGD, $L_2$ regularization and weight decay line up algebraically
- for Adam, they do not line up the same way because Adam rescales coordinates adaptively

So the thing to remember is:

$$
\text{AdamW was introduced precisely because } L_2 \text{ inside Adam is not the same as decoupled weight decay.}
$$

User asked:
my answers to the exam were, False, True, True, True, True, True, True, False, True, True, Not sure, True, can you grade?

Assistant response:
Yes. Against the answer key, that is **10 / 12**.

Correct:

- $1.1$ False
- $1.2$ True
- $1.3$ True
- $1.4$ True
- $1.5$ True
- $1.6$ True
- $1.8$ False
- $1.9$ True
- $1.10$ True
- $1.12$ True

Misses / open items:

- $1.7$: your answer was **True**, but the correct answer is **False**
- $1.11$: you put **Not sure**; the correct answer is **False**

Why $1.7$ is false:

Whitening means

$$
E[zz^T] = I,
$$

so the coordinates are uncorrelated and each has variance $1$. But uncorrelated does **not** imply independent in general. ICA exists because whitening alone is not enough to recover independence.

Why $1.11$ is false:

In Adam, adding $L_2$ regularization means the term $\lambda w$ gets mixed into the adaptively scaled gradient. In AdamW, the weight decay is applied separately from the adaptive gradient normalization. So they are not exactly the same update rule.

### Turn 61
User asked:
can you give me some more details about what exactly the adamw optimizer does?

Assistant response:
Yes. The clean way to think about AdamW is:

- it does an ordinary Adam-style adaptive gradient step
- and then it applies weight decay **separately**

At iteration $t$, suppose the gradient is

$$
g_t = \nabla f(w_t).
$$

Adam keeps two running averages:

1. first moment / momentum:
   $$
   m_t = \beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1-\beta_1) g_t
   $$

2. second moment / squared-gradient average:
   $$
   v_t = \beta_2 v_{t-1} + (1-\beta_2) g_t^2
   $$

Because these start at zero, Adam uses bias correction:

$$
\hat m_t = \frac{m_t}{1-\beta_1^t},
\qquad
\hat v_t = \frac{v_t}{1-\beta_2^t}.
$$

Then the Adam part of the step is

$$
w_t - \eta \frac{\hat m_t}{\sqrt{\hat v_t}+\varepsilon}.
$$

This means:

- coordinates with consistently large gradients get divided by a larger denominator, so their effective step sizes become smaller
- coordinates with smaller historical gradients can get relatively larger effective steps

Now AdamW adds **decoupled weight decay**:

$$
w_{t+1}
=
w_t
-\eta \frac{\hat m_t}{\sqrt{\hat v_t}+\varepsilon}
-\eta \lambda w_t.
$$

You can also factor that as

$$
w_{t+1}
=
(1-\eta\lambda) w_t
-\eta \frac{\hat m_t}{\sqrt{\hat v_t}+\varepsilon}.
$$

That second form is useful because it makes the roles very clear:

- $(1-\eta\lambda) w_t$ = shrink the weights a little
- $-\eta \frac{\hat m_t}{\sqrt{\hat v_t}+\varepsilon}$ = take the Adam adaptive gradient step

So what AdamW is doing, operationally, is:

1. estimate a momentum direction
2. estimate per-coordinate gradient scale
3. normalize the step coordinatewise
4. shrink the weights separately

Why this matters:

If you instead add $L_2$ regularization directly to the objective, then the gradient becomes

$$
g_t + \lambda w_t,
$$

and that whole expression gets fed into the Adam moments and denominators. So the regularization term gets mixed into the adaptive scaling. AdamW avoids that by keeping the decay separate.

So the shortest summary is:

$$
\text{AdamW = Adam + separate multiplicative weight shrinkage.}
$$

That is why people say the weight decay is **decoupled**.

`/Users/saahith/Downloads/IMG_7409.HEIC here are my answers to the select all... some of the answers, i wasn't really sure, and I've added annotations for those`

Assistant response:
I graded the select-all page from the photo.

Assuming I read your marked choices correctly, you got **8 / 11** questions fully correct, which is **24 / 33** on an all-or-nothing grading rule.

Your marked answers as I read them:

- $2.1$: $a,b,c,d$ -> correct
- $2.2$: $a,b,c,d$ -> correct
- $2.3$: $a,b,c,e$ -> incorrect
- $2.4$: $a,b,c,d,e$ -> incorrect
- $2.5$: $a,b,c,e$ -> correct
- $2.6$: $a,b,d$ -> correct
- $2.7$: $a,c,e$ -> incorrect
- $2.8$: $a,b,c,d$ -> correct
- $2.9$: $a,b,c,d$ -> correct
- $2.10$: $a,b,c,d$ -> correct
- $2.11$: $a,b,c,e$ -> correct

The answer key is:

- $2.1$: $a,b,c,d$
- $2.2$: $a,b,c,d$
- $2.3$: $a,c,e$
- $2.4$: $a,b,d,e$
- $2.5$: $a,b,c,e$
- $2.6$: $a,b,d$
- $2.7$: $a,b,c,e$
- $2.8$: $a,b,c,d$
- $2.9$: $a,b,c,d$
- $2.10$: $a,b,c,d$
- $2.11$: $a,b,c,e$

So the misses were:

1. $2.3$:
   - you added $b$
   - but $b$ is false because the dual function is the pointwise **infimum** of affine functions of the dual variables, not the supremum

2. $2.4$:
   - you added $c$
   - but $c$ is false because stationarity alone is not enough for constrained convex optimality; you also need feasibility and the rest of the KKT conditions

3. $2.7$:
   - you missed $b$
   - $b$ is true because for whitened data
     $$
     E[(w^T z)^2] = w^T E[zz^T] w = w^T I w = \|w\|^2
     $$

Your uncertainty annotations were useful, and they line up well with the actual misses:

- `LP` / duality precision
- KKT statement precision
- ICA whitening facts
- AdamW review
- subgradient-method rate/quantity recall

### Turn 63
User asked:
can you explain why the dual is the pointwise infimum instead of supremmum for question 2.3?

Assistant response:
Yes. The reason is tied to what the dual function is supposed to do for a **primal minimization problem**.

Start from the primal

$$
\min_x f(x)
\quad
\text{subject to}
\quad
g_i(x)\le 0,
\qquad
h_j(x)=0.
$$

Its Lagrangian is

$$
L(x,\lambda,\nu)
=
f(x)+\sum_i \lambda_i g_i(x)+\sum_j \nu_j h_j(x),
\qquad
\lambda_i \ge 0.
$$

Now fix the dual variables $(\lambda,\nu)$ and think of $L$ only as a function of $x$.

Why do we define

$$
q(\lambda,\nu)=\inf_x L(x,\lambda,\nu)?
$$

Because we want $q(\lambda,\nu)$ to be a **lower bound** on the primal optimum.

Take any feasible point $x$.

Then:

- $g_i(x)\le 0$
- $\lambda_i \ge 0$
- so $\lambda_i g_i(x)\le 0$

Also:

- $h_j(x)=0$
- so $\nu_j h_j(x)=0$

Therefore, for every feasible $x$,

$$
L(x,\lambda,\nu)\le f(x).
$$

Now take the infimum over **all** $x$:

$$
q(\lambda,\nu)=\inf_x L(x,\lambda,\nu)\le L(x,\lambda,\nu)\le f(x)
$$

for every feasible $x$.

So in particular,

$$
q(\lambda,\nu)\le p^*
$$

where $p^*$ is the primal optimum.

That is exactly what we want: each dual-feasible choice gives a lower bound, and then the dual problem tries to make that lower bound as large as possible.

So the dual problem is

$$
\max_{\lambda \ge 0,\nu} q(\lambda,\nu).
$$

If we used a supremum instead,

$$
\sup_x L(x,\lambda,\nu),
$$

then we would generally lose the lower-bound property. In fact, the supremum could be huge or even $+\infty$, which is the wrong direction for a minimization primal.

There is also a geometry reason:

- for each fixed $x$, $L(x,\lambda,\nu)$ is an affine function of $(\lambda,\nu)$
- the dual function is the pointwise **infimum** of those affine functions
- a pointwise infimum of affine functions is concave

That is why the dual function is concave.

So the short answer is:

$$
\text{infimum gives the lower envelope, and that is what produces valid lower bounds for a minimization primal.}
$$

If you want, I can also draw the “family of affine lines, dual = lower envelope” picture in words, because that is often the fastest way to remember it.

### Turn 64
User asked:
wdym the dual function is the pointwise infimum of all those affine function? my understanding is that we pick the $x$ that leads to the minimum value across all $\lambda, \nu$ values, right? is that not correct?

Assistant response:
Not quite. The order is:

1. fix $(\lambda,\nu)$
2. minimize over $x$
3. that gives one number, namely $q(\lambda,\nu)$
4. then, in the dual problem, maximize that number over $(\lambda,\nu)$

So the definition is

$$
q(\lambda,\nu)=\inf_x L(x,\lambda,\nu).
$$

That means:

- $(\lambda,\nu)$ are being held fixed
- only $x$ is being optimized inside the infimum

Then after you have built the function $q$, you solve

$$
\max_{\lambda \ge 0,\nu} q(\lambda,\nu).
$$

So you are **not** picking one magical $x$ that minimizes everything across all $(\lambda,\nu)$ at once.

The minimizing $x$ can change depending on which $(\lambda,\nu)$ you plug in.

That is what `pointwise` means.

At one specific dual point $(\lambda,\nu)$, you look at all the values

$$
L(x,\lambda,\nu)
$$

as $x$ varies, and you take the smallest one. That smallest value is $q(\lambda,\nu)$ at that point.

Why people say “pointwise infimum of affine functions”:

For each fixed $x$, the function

$$
(\lambda,\nu) \mapsto L(x,\lambda,\nu)
$$

is affine in the dual variables.

So every fixed $x$ gives you one affine function of $(\lambda,\nu)$.

Then

$$
q(\lambda,\nu)=\inf_x L(x,\lambda,\nu)
$$

means:

- at this particular $(\lambda,\nu)$
- look at the value of every one of those affine functions
- take the smallest value

That is the lower envelope.

So the mental picture is:

- fix $(\lambda,\nu)$
- scan over all $x$
- take the lowest Lagrangian value
- that gives the dual-function value there

Then later:

- move $(\lambda,\nu)$ around
- try to make that lower bound as large as possible

So the clean slogan is:

$$
\text{first minimize over } x \text{ for each fixed dual point, then maximize over the dual points.}
$$
