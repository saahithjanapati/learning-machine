### Turn 1
User asked:
can you also make a live-chat where i can ask questions about the content in the comprehensive notes

Assistant response:
I created a dedicated live-chat transcript for the Exam 2 materials so we can use it for ongoing Q&A and keep the conversation mirrored in markdown.

Use this file for the session:

`topics/optimization-for-ml/lessons/2026-04-14-exam-2-live-chat.md`

You can start asking questions about any section of the comprehensive notes, and I’ll continue appending both your prompt and my response here.

### Turn 2
User asked:
what is the alpha term in the strongly convex sgd? is that the coefficient for smoothness?

Assistant response:
No. $\alpha$ is the `strong convexity` parameter, not the smoothness parameter.

The usual convention in this course is:

- $\alpha$: strong convexity
- $\beta$: smoothness

So if $f$ is $\alpha$-strongly convex, that means

$$
f(y) \ge f(x) + \nabla f(x)^T(y-x) + \frac{\alpha}{2}\|y-x\|^2
$$

and if $f$ is $\beta$-smooth, that means

$$
f(y) \le f(x) + \nabla f(x)^T(y-x) + \frac{\beta}{2}\|y-x\|^2.
$$

So:

- $\alpha$ gives a lower quadratic curvature bound
- $\beta$ gives an upper quadratic curvature bound

That is why the condition number is

$$
\kappa = \frac{\beta}{\alpha}.
$$

In the strongly convex SGD bound

$$
\mathbb{E}\|x^k-x^*\|^2
\le
(1-\alpha\eta)^k\|x^0-x^*\|^2 + \frac{\eta G^2}{\alpha},
$$

the $\alpha$ appears because stronger curvature pulls iterates back toward the minimizer more aggressively.

### Turn 3
User asked:
in proximal gradient and gradient mapping, does g(x) have to be smooth?

Assistant response:
In the usual proximal-gradient setup, yes: $g$ is the smooth part and $h$ is the possibly nonsmooth part.

The standard split is

$$
f(x)=g(x)+h(x),
$$

where:

- $g$ is differentiable, usually $\beta$-smooth
- $h$ is convex and possibly nonsmooth

That is exactly why the update is

$$
x_{k+1}=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta h}(x_k-\eta \nabla g(x_k)).
$$

If $g$ were not smooth, then the linearization step using $\nabla g(x_k)$ would not be justified in the usual way.

---
### Turn 4
User asked:
i mean does g(x) have to be convex?

Assistant response:
Not always.

In the standard convex-composite setup,

$$
f(x)=g(x)+h(x),
$$

one usually assumes:

- $g$ is smooth and convex
- $h$ is convex and possibly nonsmooth

In that setting, yes, $g$ is convex.

But proximal gradient is also used in nonconvex settings. Then:

- $g$ is still smooth
- $g$ does not have to be convex
- $h$ is still usually proper, closed, and often convex

The update is still

$$
x_{k+1}=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta h}(x_k-\eta \nabla g(x_k)),
$$

and the gradient mapping is still useful, but the guarantee changes. In the convex case, one proves convergence to a global minimizer. In the nonconvex case, one usually only proves convergence to a stationary point or critical point.

So the clean summary is:

- for the standard convex theory from class: yes, $g$ is usually convex
- for proximal gradient as a broader method: no, $g$ does not have to be convex, but it usually still has to be smooth

---
### Turn 5
User asked:
so is the gradient mapping basically just what ends up getting added to the current position? like why is that designated as a special term?

Assistant response:
Yes, essentially.

The proximal-gradient update can be written as

$$
x_{k+1}
=
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta h}(x_k-\eta \nabla g(x_k)).
$$

The gradient mapping is defined by

$$
G_\eta(x_k)
=
\frac{1}{\eta}\left(x_k-\operatorname{prox}_{\eta h}(x_k-\eta \nabla g(x_k))\right).
$$

So rearranging,

$$
x_{k+1}=x_k-\eta G_\eta(x_k).
$$

That means $-\eta G_\eta(x_k)$ is exactly the step that gets added to the current iterate. So your intuition is right.

It is treated as a special object because it plays the role that the ordinary gradient plays in plain gradient descent.

When $h=0$,

$$
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta h}(v)=v,
$$

so

$$
G_\eta(x_k)=\nabla g(x_k),
$$

and the update becomes ordinary gradient descent.

So the point of naming it is:

- it gives one object that summarizes the full composite step
- it reduces to the gradient in the smooth case
- stationarity can be expressed as $G_\eta(x)=0$
- convergence results are often written in terms of $\|G_\eta(x)\|$

So it is not just notation for the step. It is the composite-problem analogue of the gradient, which is why it is important.

---
### Turn 6
User asked:
can you explain the math behind the problem 1.1?

Assistant response:
Yes. The point of Problem 1.1 is to show how a stochastic gradient can come from a single random sample.

The objective is

$$
f(x)=\frac12 \mathbb{E}(X-x)^2.
$$

This means you are trying to choose the scalar $x$ that minimizes the average squared error between $x$ and the random variable $X$.

First expand the square:

$$
(X-x)^2 = X^2 - 2xX + x^2.
$$

So

$$
f(x)=\frac12 \mathbb{E}(X^2-2xX+x^2).
$$

Now use linearity of expectation:

$$
f(x)=\frac12 \left(\mathbb{E}[X^2]-2x\mathbb{E}[X]+x^2\right).
$$

Since $\mu=\mathbb{E}[X]$, this becomes

$$
f(x)=\frac12 \left(\mathbb{E}[X^2]-2x\mu+x^2\right).
$$

Now differentiate with respect to $x$. The term $\mathbb{E}[X^2]$ is a constant, so its derivative is zero. The derivative of $-2x\mu$ is $-2\mu$, and the derivative of $x^2$ is $2x$. Therefore

$$
\nabla f(x)=\frac12(-2\mu+2x)=x-\mu.
$$

That is the true gradient.

Now define the stochastic gradient candidate

$$
g(x;X)=x-X.
$$

This uses one sample of $X$ instead of the unknown mean $\mu$. To check that it is unbiased, take expectation:

$$
\mathbb{E}[g(x;X)\mid x]
=
\mathbb{E}[x-X\mid x]
=
x-\mathbb{E}[X]
=
x-\mu
=
\nabla f(x).
$$

So although $x-X$ is random, its average value is exactly the true gradient.

That is why it is a valid stochastic gradient: each sample gives a noisy estimate of the full gradient, and averaging over the randomness recovers the exact gradient.

Finally, plug it into SGD:

$$
x^{t+1}=x^t-\eta_t g(x^t;X_t)
=
x^t-\eta_t(x^t-X_t)
=
(1-\eta_t)x^t+\eta_t X_t.
$$

This last form is important: it says the new iterate is a weighted average of the old iterate and the new sample.

So the big idea of Problem 1.1 is:

- the full gradient is $x-\mu$
- the sample-based version is $x-X$
- replacing $\mu$ by one random sample gives noise, but not bias
- SGD therefore updates by blending the old estimate with fresh data

---
### Turn 7
User asked:
wait i don't really understand what the question is asking... are we trying to show g() is SGD estimate of f, which we are trying to minimize?

Assistant response:
Almost. The thing to be careful about is:

- $f(x)$ is the objective function we want to minimize
- $\nabla f(x)$ is the true gradient of that objective
- $g(x;X)$ is not an estimate of $f(x)$
- $g(x;X)$ is an estimate of $\nabla f(x)$

So the question is asking you to show that $g(x;X)$ is a valid stochastic gradient for the objective $f(x)$.

More concretely, the problem gives:

$$
f(x)=\frac12 \mathbb{E}(X-x)^2
$$

and defines

$$
g(x;X)=x-X.
$$

Then it asks you to prove that $g$ is an unbiased stochastic gradient. That means you must show

$$
\mathbb{E}[g(x;X)\mid x]=\nabla f(x).
$$

So the logical flow is:

1. compute the true gradient $\nabla f(x)$
2. compute the expectation of the sample-based quantity $g(x;X)$
3. show they are equal

If they are equal, then $g(x;X)$ is exactly the kind of noisy gradient estimate SGD is allowed to use.

So yes, we are minimizing $f$, but the thing we are verifying is that $g$ is a stochastic estimate of the gradient of $f$, not of $f$ itself.

That is why the update uses

$$
x^{t+1}=x^t-\eta_t g(x^t;X_t),
$$

because SGD always plugs in a stochastic gradient estimate where ordinary gradient descent would use the exact gradient.

---
### Turn 8
User asked:
wait so, we're basically trying to learn the true value (or expected value of X), via SGD... and the value we get for the gradient is g(x;X) is x-X? so it's basically saying move in the direction of the recent draw of the random variable X? and the original function f(x) is bascially MSE between the estimate and the RV? and when we plug this into the SGD equation, we get a clear weighted expression that moves the estimate closer to the most recent draw?

Assistant response:
Yes. That is basically the right interpretation.

The clean picture is:

- $x$ is your current estimate
- $X$ is a random draw from the population
- $\mu = \mathbb{E}[X]$ is the true mean
- $f(x)=\frac12 \mathbb{E}(X-x)^2$ is the expected squared error between your estimate and the random variable

So minimizing $f(x)$ means: choose the scalar $x$ that best matches $X$ in mean-squared error. The minimizer turns out to be the mean $\mu$.

The true gradient is

$$
\nabla f(x)=x-\mu.
$$

But you usually do not know $\mu$, so you cannot compute this exact gradient directly. Instead you use one sample $X$, giving the stochastic gradient

$$
g(x;X)=x-X.
$$

This says:

- if your estimate $x$ is larger than the sampled value $X$, then $x-X>0$, so the update moves downward
- if your estimate $x$ is smaller than the sampled value $X$, then $x-X<0$, so the update moves upward

So yes, each SGD step moves the estimate toward the most recent draw.

Plugging into SGD gives

$$
x^{t+1}=x^t-\eta_t(x^t-X_t)
=(1-\eta_t)x^t+\eta_t X_t.
$$

This is the clearest interpretation: the new estimate is a weighted average of

- the old estimate $x^t$
- the new sample $X_t$

So your summary is correct:

- the objective is expected MSE
- the target being learned is the population mean
- the stochastic gradient is sample-based
- the SGD update pulls the estimate toward the latest observation

The only refinement is: the update is not saying the latest draw is the true value. It is saying the latest draw is one noisy piece of information about the true mean, so you move partway toward it.

---
### Turn 9
User asked:
and i guess it's important the function is defined as expectation of X... i guess it wouldn't even make sense to do expectation over x...

Assistant response:
Yes. That is exactly right.

In this setup:

- $X$ is random
- $x$ is the decision variable you control

So the expectation is taken over the randomness in $X$, not over $x$.

The objective

$$
f(x)=\frac12\mathbb{E}(X-x)^2
$$

means:

"for a fixed choice of $x$, what is the average squared loss over random draws of $X$?"

That gives an ordinary deterministic function of $x$ after averaging over the data distribution.

It would not make sense in the same way to take expectation over $x$, because $x$ is not the source of randomness here. It is the parameter you are optimizing.

So the logic is:

1. nature draws $X$
2. you choose $x$
3. loss is $(X-x)^2$
4. the objective is the expected loss over the randomness in $X$

This is the standard statistical-learning setup:

- random data
- deterministic parameter
- optimize expected loss

If $x$ were itself random, then one could talk about expectation over $x$, but that would be a different model. In this problem, $x$ is just the scalar you are trying to learn.

---
### Turn 10
User asked:
in question 1.2, is G the gradient noise? is that just some random term?

Assistant response:
Not exactly.

In the bound

$$
\mathbb{E}\|x^k-x^*\|^2
\le
(1-\alpha \eta)^k\|x^0-x^*\|^2+\frac{\eta G^2}{\alpha},
$$

$G$ is usually a uniform bound on the size of the stochastic gradient, such as

$$
\mathbb{E}\|g(x;\xi)\|^2 \le G^2
$$

or sometimes

$$
\|g(x;\xi)\| \le G
\quad \text{almost surely.}
$$

So $G$ is not "the noise itself." It is a constant that upper-bounds how large the stochastic gradient can be, or how large its second moment can be.

The actual randomness is inside $g(x;\xi)$ or inside the difference

$$
g(x;\xi)-\nabla f(x),
$$

which is the gradient noise.

So:

- $g(x;\xi)$ is the random stochastic gradient
- $g(x;\xi)-\nabla f(x)$ is the noise
- $G$ is a deterministic bound controlling the size of that random quantity

That is why the residual term

$$
\frac{\eta G^2}{\alpha}
$$

acts like a noise floor: if the stochastic gradients can remain large because of randomness, fixed-step SGD cannot collapse all the way to zero error.

---
### Turn 11
User asked:
what does this term mean: $\xi_t$ is that just the learning rate?

Assistant response:
No. $\xi_t$ is the random variable or random sample used to generate the stochastic gradient. It is not the learning rate.

In the SGD update

$$
x^{t+1}=x^t-\eta_t g(x^t;\xi_t),
$$

the roles are:

- $\eta_t$: step size or learning rate
- $\xi_t$: randomness at iteration $t$
- $g(x^t;\xi_t)$: stochastic gradient built from that randomness

So depending on the setting, $\xi_t$ could be:

- a sampled data point
- a sampled example index
- a mini-batch
- additive noise
- a random coordinate

For example, if

$$
f(x)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n f_i(x),
$$

then one common choice is:

- sample $\xi_t \in \{1,\dots,n\}$
- define $g(x;\xi_t)=\nabla f_{\xi_t}(x)$

Then $\xi_t$ simply means "which component did I sample this iteration?"

So the clean distinction is:

- $\eta_t$ controls how large the step is
- $\xi_t$ controls what random information was used to form the step

---
### Turn 12
User asked:
for sgd, how do you get this step:

$$
\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2
=
\|x^t-x^*\|^2
-2\eta g(x^t;\xi_t)^T(x^t-x^*)
+\eta^2\|g(x^t;\xi_t)\|^2
$$

Assistant response:
It comes from substituting the SGD update and then expanding a squared norm.

Start with

$$
x^{t+1}=x^t-\eta g(x^t;\xi_t).
$$

Subtract $x^*$ from both sides:

$$
x^{t+1}-x^* = x^t-\eta g(x^t;\xi_t)-x^*.
$$

Group the terms:

$$
x^{t+1}-x^* = (x^t-x^*)-\eta g(x^t;\xi_t).
$$

Now square the norm:

$$
\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2
=
\|(x^t-x^*)-\eta g(x^t;\xi_t)\|^2.
$$

Use the standard identity

$$
\|a-b\|^2=\|a\|^2-2a^Tb+\|b\|^2.
$$

Here,

$$
a=x^t-x^*,
\qquad
b=\eta g(x^t;\xi_t).
$$

So

$$
\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2
=
\|x^t-x^*\|^2
-2(x^t-x^*)^T(\eta g(x^t;\xi_t))
+\|\eta g(x^t;\xi_t)\|^2.
$$

Now simplify the two terms involving $\eta$:

$$
\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2
=
\|x^t-x^*\|^2
-2\eta g(x^t;\xi_t)^T(x^t-x^*)
+\eta^2\|g(x^t;\xi_t)\|^2.
$$

So this step is just:

1. plug in the update
2. subtract $x^*$
3. expand with $\|a-b\|^2$

---
### Turn 13
User asked:
i need you to walk thought the proof for 1.1 in sgd even slower please... i don't understand the step where we take the conditional expectation... im kinda slow so please walk me through it

Assistant response:
Yes. The conditional-expectation step is the place where SGD proofs usually start to feel slippery, so it is worth slowing it down a lot.

I will use the convex nonsmooth SGD proof structure, because that is where this step first appears clearly.

We start from the expanded recursion

$$
\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2
=
\|x^t-x^*\|^2
-2\eta g(x^t;\xi_t)^T(x^t-x^*)
+\eta^2\|g(x^t;\xi_t)\|^2.
$$

Now ask: at iteration $t$, what is random and what is already fixed?

- $x^t$ is the current iterate
- $x^*$ is the optimizer
- $\eta$ is the stepsize
- $\xi_t$ is the new random draw at this iteration
- so $g(x^t;\xi_t)$ is random because it depends on $\xi_t$

The phrase "take conditional expectation given $x^t$" means:

"Pretend I am standing at iteration $t$ and I already know the current point $x^t$. I now average only over the fresh randomness $\xi_t$."

So when we write

$$
\mathbb{E}[\cdot \mid x^t],
$$

we are treating $x^t$ as fixed inside that expectation.

That means:

$$
\mathbb{E}[\|x^t-x^*\|^2 \mid x^t] = \|x^t-x^*\|^2
$$

because once $x^t$ is known, that quantity is just a number.

Similarly,

$$
\mathbb{E}[\eta^2\|g(x^t;\xi_t)\|^2 \mid x^t]
=
\eta^2 \mathbb{E}[\|g(x^t;\xi_t)\|^2 \mid x^t].
$$

We can pull out $\eta^2$ because it is not random.

Now look at the middle term:

$$
\mathbb{E}\big[g(x^t;\xi_t)^T(x^t-x^*) \mid x^t\big].
$$

Since $x^t-x^*$ is fixed when conditioning on $x^t$, we can pull it outside:

$$
\mathbb{E}\big[g(x^t;\xi_t)^T(x^t-x^*) \mid x^t\big]
=
\mathbb{E}[g(x^t;\xi_t)\mid x^t]^T (x^t-x^*).
$$

This is the key move.

So after taking conditional expectation, the recursion becomes

$$
\mathbb{E}[\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2 \mid x^t]
=
\|x^t-x^*\|^2
-2\eta \,\mathbb{E}[g(x^t;\xi_t)\mid x^t]^T(x^t-x^*)
+\eta^2 \mathbb{E}[\|g(x^t;\xi_t)\|^2\mid x^t].
$$

Now use the two assumptions:

1. unbiasedness / subgradient assumption

$$
g_{x^t}\doteq \mathbb{E}[g(x^t;\xi_t)\mid x^t] \in \partial f(x^t)
$$

2. bounded second moment

$$
\mathbb{E}[\|g(x^t;\xi_t)\|^2\mid x^t] \le G^2.
$$

Substituting those in gives

$$
\mathbb{E}[\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2 \mid x^t]
\le
\|x^t-x^*\|^2
-2\eta g_{x^t}^T(x^t-x^*)
+\eta^2 G^2.
$$

That is all the conditional-expectation step is doing.

The intuition is:

- before conditioning, the next iterate is random because the new stochastic gradient is random
- after conditioning on $x^t$, the only randomness left is the one-step noise $\xi_t$
- averaging over that noise replaces the random gradient by its mean
- that mean is exactly the object we know how to relate to the objective, namely $g_{x^t}$

The reason this step matters is that it converts a random update into something deterministic enough to analyze.

If it helps, here is the whole step in plain English:

1. write the one-step progress formula
2. freeze the current iterate $x^t$
3. average over the fresh random draw $\xi_t$
4. replace the random gradient by its conditional mean
5. use the theorem assumptions on that mean and on the second moment

So the hardest conceptual point is just this:

$$
\mathbb{E}[g(x^t;\xi_t)^T(x^t-x^*)\mid x^t]
=
\mathbb{E}[g(x^t;\xi_t)\mid x^t]^T(x^t-x^*)
$$

because $(x^t-x^*)$ is fixed once you condition on $x^t$.

---
### Turn 14
User asked:
what is the subgradient inequality again?

Assistant response:
For a convex function $f$, if $g \in \partial f(x)$ is a subgradient at $x$, then the subgradient inequality is

$$
f(y) \ge f(x) + g^T(y-x)
\qquad \text{for all } y.
$$

This says that the affine function

$$
f(x) + g^T(y-x)
$$

is a global lower bound on $f(y)$.

Geometrically, it is the nonsmooth analogue of the tangent-line lower-bound property for differentiable convex functions.

If $f$ is differentiable, then the subgradient is just the gradient, so it becomes

$$
f(y) \ge f(x) + \nabla f(x)^T(y-x).
$$

In the SGD proof, we usually use it with

- the current point $x=x^t$
- the comparison point $y=x^*$
- the subgradient $g_{x^t} \in \partial f(x^t)$

Then it becomes

$$
f(x^*) \ge f(x^t) + g_{x^t}^T(x^*-x^t).
$$

Rearranging gives

$$
-g_{x^t}^T(x^t-x^*) \le f(x^*) - f(x^t),
$$

which is exactly the form used in the proof.

### Turn 15
User asked:
can you explain step 5 in more detail?

Assistant response:
Yes. I will go slower, and I will use this format:

- original version
- new version
- exact substitution being made

From here on, when we make substitutions in proof explanations, I will format them this way.

Step 4 ended with

$$
\mathbb{E}[\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2\mid x^t]
\le
\|x^t-x^*\|^2
+2\eta(f(x^*)-f(x^t))
+\eta^2 G^2.
$$

Step 5 says: remove the conditioning and then sum over $t$.

## Part A: Remove the conditioning

The idea is that this equation is still conditional on $x^t$. We want an ordinary expectation.

Original version:

$$
\mathbb{E}[\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2\mid x^t]
\le
\|x^t-x^*\|^2
+2\eta(f(x^*)-f(x^t))
+\eta^2 G^2.
$$

New version:

$$
\mathbb{E}\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2
\le
\mathbb{E}\|x^t-x^*\|^2
+2\eta\big(f(x^*)-\mathbb{E}[f(x^t)]\big)
+\eta^2 G^2.
$$

Substitution being made:

- <span style="color:#fca5a5">$\mathbb{E}[\cdot \mid x^t]$ becomes $\mathbb{E}[\cdot]$</span> by taking expectation again
- this uses the tower property

$$
\mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}[Z\mid x^t]]=\mathbb{E}[Z].
$$

So we are not changing the mathematics arbitrarily. We are applying expectation to both sides and using the rule above.

## Part B: Sum the inequality over all iterations

Now take that one-step inequality and write it for every $t=0,1,\dots,k-1$, then add them.

Original version:

$$
\mathbb{E}\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2
\le
\mathbb{E}\|x^t-x^*\|^2
+2\eta\big(f(x^*)-\mathbb{E}[f(x^t)]\big)
+\eta^2 G^2.
$$

New version after summing:

$$
\sum_{t=0}^{k-1}\mathbb{E}\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2
\le
\sum_{t=0}^{k-1}\mathbb{E}\|x^t-x^*\|^2
+2\eta\sum_{t=0}^{k-1}\big(f(x^*)-\mathbb{E}[f(x^t)]\big)
+k\eta^2 G^2.
$$

Substitution being made:

- <span style="color:#86efac">one inequality at time $t$ becomes a sum of inequalities over $t=0,\dots,k-1$</span>

## Part C: Telescope the distance terms

Now focus only on the distance sums.

Original version:

$$
\sum_{t=0}^{k-1}\mathbb{E}\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2
\le
\sum_{t=0}^{k-1}\mathbb{E}\|x^t-x^*\|^2
+2\eta\sum_{t=0}^{k-1}\big(f(x^*)-\mathbb{E}[f(x^t)]\big)
+k\eta^2 G^2.
$$

Move the distance sums to opposite sides:

$$
\sum_{t=0}^{k-1}\mathbb{E}\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2
-\sum_{t=0}^{k-1}\mathbb{E}\|x^t-x^*\|^2
\le
2\eta\sum_{t=0}^{k-1}\big(f(x^*)-\mathbb{E}[f(x^t)]\big)
+k\eta^2 G^2.
$$

Now write out the left-hand side:

$$
\big(\mathbb{E}\|x^1-x^*\|^2+\mathbb{E}\|x^2-x^*\|^2+\cdots+\mathbb{E}\|x^k-x^*\|^2\big)
$$

minus

$$
\big(\mathbb{E}\|x^0-x^*\|^2+\mathbb{E}\|x^1-x^*\|^2+\cdots+\mathbb{E}\|x^{k-1}-x^*\|^2\big).
$$

Everything cancels except the first negative term and the last positive term, so this becomes

$$
\mathbb{E}\|x^k-x^*\|^2-\|x^0-x^*\|^2.
$$

Substitution being made:

- <span style="color:#7dd3fc">the two long sums are replaced by a telescoping difference</span>

That is the whole meaning of "the distance term telescopes."

## Part D: Rearrange to isolate the average suboptimality

After telescoping, we get

$$
\mathbb{E}\|x^k-x^*\|^2-\|x^0-x^*\|^2
\le
2\eta\sum_{t=0}^{k-1}\big(f(x^*)-\mathbb{E}[f(x^t)]\big)
+k\eta^2 G^2.
$$

Rearrange:

$$
2\eta\sum_{t=0}^{k-1}\big(\mathbb{E}[f(x^t)]-f(x^*)\big)
\le
\|x^0-x^*\|^2
+k\eta^2 G^2.
$$

Now divide by $2\eta k$:

$$
\frac{1}{k}\sum_{t=0}^{k-1}\big(\mathbb{E}[f(x^t)]-f(x^*)\big)
\le
\frac{\|x^0-x^*\|^2}{2\eta k}
+\frac{G^2\eta}{2}.
$$

Substitution being made:

- <span style="color:#fcd34d">the summed inequality is converted into an average by dividing by $k$</span>

So the purpose of Step 5 is:

1. turn the one-step bound into a many-step bound
2. make the distance terms collapse by telescoping
3. isolate the average function-value error

Then Step 6 uses convexity to replace the average of $f(x^t)$ by $f(\bar x_k)$.

User asked:
also whenever we make a substitution, can you list the og version, and the new version, and can you just highlight the substition that you are making with some color

Assistant response:
Yes. I will do that going forward for proof walkthroughs in this live chat.

The format will be:

- original version
- new version
- highlighted substitution being made

I will keep the coloring local to the explanation so it does not change the actual notes unless you ask for that separately.

### Turn 17
User asked:
can you explain this line in exam 2 worked problem sgd:
$$
\mathbb{E}_\xi[g(x;\xi)]
=
\mathbb{E}_\xi[\nabla f_\xi(x)]
=
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \nabla f_i(x).
$$

Assistant response:
Yes. The whole point is that $\xi$ is a random index, and it is chosen uniformly from $\{1,\dots,n\}$.

So when you see

$$
g(x;\xi)=\nabla f_\xi(x),
$$

that means:

- if $\xi=1$, then $g(x;\xi)=\nabla f_1(x)$
- if $\xi=2$, then $g(x;\xi)=\nabla f_2(x)$
- ...
- if $\xi=n$, then $g(x;\xi)=\nabla f_n(x)$

So $g(x;\xi)$ is a random variable that takes one of the values

$$
\nabla f_1(x),\nabla f_2(x),\dots,\nabla f_n(x)
$$

with equal probability $\frac{1}{n}$.

That is why

$$
\mathbb{E}_\xi[g(x;\xi)]
=
\mathbb{E}_\xi[\nabla f_\xi(x)]
$$

becomes

$$
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \nabla f_i(x).
$$

It is just the expectation formula for a discrete uniform random variable:

if a random variable takes values $a_1,\dots,a_n$ each with probability $\frac{1}{n}$, then

$$
\mathbb{E}[A]=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n a_i.
$$

Here, the role of $A$ is being played by the random vector $\nabla f_\xi(x)$.

So the line is not doing anything mysterious. It is just saying:

- pick one component gradient uniformly at random
- the expected value of that random pick is the average of all component gradients

And that average is exactly

$$
\nabla f(x)=\nabla\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n f_i(x)\right)
=
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \nabla f_i(x).
$$

So the random single-example gradient is unbiased for the full gradient.
