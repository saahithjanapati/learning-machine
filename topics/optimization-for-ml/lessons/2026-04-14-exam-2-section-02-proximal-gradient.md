This is the short table worth memorizing.

Two things matter just as much as the rates themselves:

- which assumptions are needed for each line
- what quantity is actually being controlled

That is why the table separates one-step descent statements from $k$-step convergence rates.


## 2.00 Where This Topic Came From in the Course

This topic was built across several lectures.

The course path was roughly:

1. `Feb 10`: subgradient method
- generic nonsmooth optimization
- arbitrary subgradients need not be descent directions
- convergence is slower and less structured

2. `Feb 12`: projected gradient and projected subgradient
- "take a step, then project"
- projection already has the same quadratic-correction form that later becomes prox

3. `Feb 17`: optimality conditions and soft-thresholding
- solve simple $\ell_1$-regularized problems by subgradient optimality
- derive the soft-thresholding operator explicitly

4. `Feb 17+24`: main proximal-gradient lecture
- derive proximal gradient from local quadratic approximation
- connect prox to projection
- define ISTA and the gradient mapping
- prove the main descent lemma and the $O(1/k)$ theorem

5. `Feb 24` examples lecture
- study the case $g=0$
- prove descent without smoothness
- extend the intuition to matrix-valued problems such as matrix completion

So the topic is not just one theorem. It is the culmination of:

- subgradients
- projections
- optimality conditions
- soft-thresholding
- composite-optimization convergence proofs

## 2.0 Why Proximal Gradient Exists

The lecture explicitly contrasted proximal gradient with the subgradient method.

For a generic convex nonsmooth objective, subgradient descent gives a rate of order $O(1/\sqrt{k})$ and can be slow. But many nonsmooth objectives actually look like

$$
f(x)=g(x)+h(x),
$$

where:

- $g$ is differentiable and often $\beta$-smooth
- $h$ is not differentiable, but is "simple" in the sense that its prox can be computed efficiently

The proximal-gradient lecture's main message was:

- we cannot beat nonsmooth lower bounds for arbitrary nonsmooth functions
- but for composite objectives, we can often recover gradient-descent-style guarantees

This is why the lecture introduces ISTA and proves an $O(1/k)$ rate, even though the full objective $f$ is not smooth.

The February 10 subgradient lecture matters here because it explains what proximal gradient is improving on.

In the subgradient method, the update

$$
x^+=x-\eta g_x,
\qquad
g_x\in \partial f(x),
$$

need not be a descent step. The lecture explicitly emphasized that an arbitrary subgradient can increase the objective.

Proximal gradient avoids that failure mode by using structure:

- a true gradient for the smooth part $g$
- an implicit correction step for the nonsmooth part $h$

That is why the method has clean descent lemmas while the plain subgradient method usually does not.

The easiest mental contrast is:

- subgradient method: "pick some valid slope and hope it helps"
- proximal gradient: "use the exact gradient where possible, then fix the step using the structure of the nonsmooth term"

## 2.1 Three Ways to Motivate the Update

The lectures gave several equivalent ways to understand the algorithm. You should know at least two of them.

### 2.1.1 Local Quadratic Approximation

If $f$ were differentiable, gradient descent can be motivated as minimizing the local model

$$
f(x)+\nabla f(x)^T(z-x)+\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-x\|^2.
$$

If this expression feels mysterious, break it into pieces:

- $f(x)$ is just the current function value, so it is a constant with respect to $z$
- $\nabla f(x)^T(z-x)$ is the first-order linear approximation telling you how the function changes near $x$
- $\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-x\|^2$ is a penalty for moving too far away from the current point

That last term is crucial. If you tried to minimize only

$$
f(x)+\nabla f(x)^T(z-x),
$$

then the problem would usually be unbounded below: as long as $\nabla f(x)\neq 0$, you could keep moving farther and farther in the direction $-\nabla f(x)$ and make the linear term smaller forever.

So the quadratic term is what turns "here is a good local direction" into "here is a finite local step."

You can also think of it as replacing the true Hessian in a second-order model by the simpler matrix

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}I.
$$

That is why the minimizer becomes the usual GD step instead of something unbounded.

Let us do that algebra explicitly.

We want to minimize

$$
\phi(z)=f(x)+\nabla f(x)^T(z-x)+\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-x\|^2.
$$

Since $f(x)$ does not depend on $z$, it does not a
ffect the minimizer. So this is equivalent to minimizing

$$
\nabla f(x)^T(z-x)+\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-x\|^2.
$$

Now differentiate with respect to $z$:

$$
\nabla_z \phi(z)=\nabla f(x)+\frac{1}{\eta}(z-x).
$$

Set this equal to zero:

$$
\nabla f(x)+\frac{1}{\eta}(z-x)=0.
$$

So

$$
z-x=-\eta \nabla f(x),
$$

which means

$$
z=x-\eta \nabla f(x).
$$

That is the ordinary gradient-descent update.

For the composite objective $f=g+h$, we cannot differentiate $h$, so we only linearize and regularize the smooth part:

$$
x^+
=
\arg\min_z
\left\{
g(x)+\nabla g(x)^T(z-x)+\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-x\|^2+h(z)
\right\}.
$$

Now slow down the algebra.

First, $g(x)$ is a constant with respect to $z$, so it does not affect the minimizer. Therefore we can drop it and minimize

$$
\nabla g(x)^T(z-x)+\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-x\|^2+h(z).
$$

Next, expand the quadratic-looking part into a completed square.

We want to show that

$$
\nabla g(x)^T(z-x)+\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-x\|^2
$$

is the same as

$$
\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))\|^2
$$

up to constants that do not depend on $z$.

Write

$$
z-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))=(z-x)+\eta \nabla g(x).
$$

Then

$$
\|z-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))\|^2
=
\|(z-x)+\eta \nabla g(x)\|^2.
$$

Expand:

$$
\|(z-x)+\eta \nabla g(x)\|^2
=
\|z-x\|^2+2\eta \nabla g(x)^T(z-x)+\eta^2\|\nabla g(x)\|^2.
$$

Now multiply by $\frac{1}{2\eta}$:

$$
\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))\|^2
=
\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-x\|^2+\nabla g(x)^T(z-x)+\frac{\eta}{2}\|\nabla g(x)\|^2.
$$

So the only difference between the two expressions is the constant

$$
\frac{\eta}{2}\|\nabla g(x)\|^2,
$$

which does not depend on $z$ and therefore does not change the minimizer.

That is why we can rewrite the update as:

$$
x^+
=
\arg\min_z
\left\{
\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-(x-\eta \nabla g(x))\|^2+h(z)
\right\}.
$$

This is exactly a proximal operator evaluation.

So the algorithm is:

1. take a usual gradient step for $g$
2. correct that proposal by solving the prox problem for $h$


### 2.1.2 As a Generalization of Projected Gradient Descent

If $h=\mathbb{I}_C$ is the indicator of a convex set $C$, then

$$
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(v)
=
\arg\min_{z\in C}\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-v\|^2,
$$

which is just the Euclidean projection of $v$ onto $C$.

So if

$$
f(x)=g(x)+\mathbb{I}_C(x),
$$

proximal gradient becomes

$$
x^{t+1}=\Pi_C(x^t-\eta \nabla g(x^t)),
$$

which is exactly projected gradient descent.

This is conceptually important:

- ordinary GD is the case $h=0$
- projected GD is the case $h=\mathbb{I}_C$
- proximal GD is the common generalization

So if you already understand projected GD, you already understand half the idea of proximal methods. Proximal gradient is just saying:

- maybe the "constraint-like" part is not literally a constraint set
- but it can still be handled by a correction step that looks projection-like

#### Projected Gradient Descent Refresher

If this connection feels fuzzy, here is the slow version.

Suppose the problem is

$$
\min_{x\in C} g(x),
$$

where:

- $g$ is differentiable
- $C$ is a convex feasible set

Ordinary gradient descent would ignore the constraint and take the step

$$
y^{t+1}=x^t-\eta_t \nabla g(x^t).
$$

But there is a problem: the point $y^{t+1}$ might not lie in $C$.

So projected gradient descent does two steps:

1. take the usual gradient step
$$
y^{t+1}=x^t-\eta_t \nabla g(x^t)
$$
2. project back onto the feasible set
$$
x^{t+1}=P_C(y^{t+1})
$$

Here

$$
P_C(y)=\arg\min_{z\in C}\frac12\|z-y\|^2
$$

means:

"among all feasible points in $C$, choose the one closest to $y$."

So projected gradient descent is literally:

- try the unconstrained gradient step
- if that step leaves the feasible set, pull it back to the nearest feasible point

Now connect this with proximal gradient.

Define the indicator function of the set $C$ by

$$
\mathbb{I}_C(x)=
\begin{cases}
0 & x\in C \\
\infty & x\notin C.
\end{cases}
$$

This notation looks strange at first, but it is just a trick for encoding constraints as part of the objective.

Why does this work?

If you minimize

$$
g(x)+\mathbb{I}_C(x),
$$

then:

- points inside $C$ have objective value $g(x)+0=g(x)$
- points outside $C$ have objective value $g(x)+\infty=\infty$

So any minimizer must lie in $C$. In other words,

$$
\min_{x\in C} g(x)
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\min_x g(x)+\mathbb{I}_C(x)
$$

are the same optimization problem written in two different ways.

Now compute the prox of the indicator:

$$
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,\mathbb{I}_C}(v)
=
\arg\min_z
\left\{
\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-v\|^2+\mathbb{I}_C(z)
\right\}.
$$

Because $\mathbb{I}_C(z)=\infty$ outside $C$, the minimization is automatically forced to stay inside $C$. So this becomes

$$
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,\mathbb{I}_C}(v)
=
\arg\min_{z\in C}\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-v\|^2.
$$

The factor $\frac{1}{2\eta}$ does not change the minimizer, so this is exactly

$$
P_C(v).
$$

That is the full meaning of

$$
h=\mathbb{I}_C.
$$

It means:

- the nonsmooth term is not a penalty like $\lambda\|x\|_1$
- instead it is a hard constraint saying "you must stay in the set $C$"

So proximal gradient with $h=\mathbb{I}_C$ becomes

$$
x^{t+1}
=
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,\mathbb{I}_C}(x^t-\eta \nabla g(x^t))
=
P_C(x^t-\eta \nabla g(x^t)),
$$

which is exactly projected gradient descent.

This is the clean bridge:

- projected GD is prox-GD with a set indicator
- prox-GD is projected GD generalized from sets to more general nonsmooth structure

### 2.1.3 As a Majorization-Minimization Method

If $g$ is $\beta$-smooth and $\eta\le 1/\beta$, then

$$
g(z)\le g(x)+\nabla g(x)^T(z-x)+\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-x\|^2.
$$

So the quadratic model

$$
\hat g_\eta(z)
=
g(x)+\nabla g(x)^T(z-x)+\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-x\|^2
$$

is an upper bound on $g(z)$ that is tight at $z=x$.

Therefore

$$
f(z)=g(z)+h(z)\le \hat g_\eta(z)+h(z).
$$

The proximal-gradient step simply minimizes this upper bound. This is the MM viewpoint:

- build a tight upper bound at the current iterate
- minimize the upper bound
- repeat

This gives a good intuitive reason for why the algorithm descends.

If you want one sentence for this whole subsection, it is:

"At each step, proximal gradient minimizes an easier upper-bound model of the true objective."

## 2.2 Core Definitions

### 2.2.1 Proximal Operator

For a convex function $h$, define

$$
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(v)
=
\arg\min_z
\left\{
\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-v\|^2+h(z)
\right\}.
$$

You should read this as:

"Find a point that balances staying close to $v$ and making $h$ small."

The lecture emphasized that $\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}$ depends only on $h$, not on $g$.

This is useful conceptually because it means:

- once you know the prox for a regularizer $h$, you can reuse it in many different problems
- the data-fit term $g$ might change from problem to problem
- but the nonsmooth correction rule stays the same

### 2.2.2 Proximal-Gradient Update

The algorithm can be written in two stages:

$$
y^{t+1}=x^t-\eta_t \nabla g(x^t),
\qquad
x^{t+1}=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta_t,h}(y^{t+1}).
$$

Or directly as

$$
x^{t+1}
=
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta_t,h}(x^t-\eta_t \nabla g(x^t)).
$$

In words:

1. ignore $h$ for one moment and take the usual gradient step for $g$
2. take the resulting point and "clean it up" using the prox for $h$

### 2.2.3 Gradient Mapping

The lecture introduces the generalized gradient

$$
G_\eta(x)
=
\frac{1}{\eta}
\left(
x-\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x-\eta \nabla g(x))
\right).
$$

This lets us write the update in gradient-descent form:

$$
x^{t+1}=x^t-\eta_t G_{\eta_t}(x^t).
$$

This definition matters for several reasons:

- if $h=0$, then $G_\eta(x)=\nabla g(x)$
- if $h=\mathbb{I}_C$, then $G_\eta(x)$ is the projected-gradient analogue
- convergence proofs are written in terms of $\|G_\eta(x)\|$
- stationarity is expressed as $G_\eta(x)=0$

So the gradient mapping is not just notation for the step. It is the natural substitute for the gradient in the composite setting.

If that still feels abstract, rewrite the definition one more time:

$$
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x-\eta \nabla g(x))=x-\eta G_\eta(x).
$$

This tells you exactly what $G_\eta(x)$ is doing.

Start with the raw gradient proposal

$$
x-\eta \nabla g(x).
$$

Then apply the prox correction to get the actual next point

$$
x^+=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x-\eta \nabla g(x)).
$$

The vector

$$
x-x^+
$$

is the total change from the current point to the next point. Dividing by $\eta$ gives a gradient-like object:

$$
G_\eta(x)=\frac{x-x^+}{\eta}.
$$

So:

- $-\eta G_\eta(x)$ is the actual step
- $G_\eta(x)$ is the step normalized to look like a generalized gradient

This is exactly parallel to ordinary GD:

$$
x^+=x-\eta \nabla f(x).
$$

There, the actual step is $-\eta \nabla f(x)$. Here, the actual step is $-\eta G_\eta(x)$.

So if you ever forget what the gradient mapping means, remember this:

- $\nabla f(x)$ tells you what smooth GD would do
- $G_\eta(x)$ tells you what composite GD actually does after the prox correction

## 2.3 Special Cases You Should Know

### 2.3.1 Ordinary Gradient Descent

If $h=0$, then

$$
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(v)=v,
$$

so

$$
x^{t+1}=x^t-\eta \nabla g(x^t).
$$

### 2.3.2 Projected Gradient Descent

If $h=\mathbb{I}_C$, then

$$
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(v)=\Pi_C(v),
$$

so proximal gradient becomes projected GD.

This is exactly the February 12 projected-gradient update:

$$
y^{t+1}=x^t-\eta_t \nabla f(x^t),
\qquad
x^{t+1}=P_C(y^{t+1}).
$$

So projected GD should be viewed as a special proximal method, not as a separate unrelated algorithm.

### 2.3.3 Pure Proximal Minimization: the Case $g=0$

When $g=0$, the update reduces to

$$
x^{t+1}=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x^t).
$$

This case is useful because it shows the proximal step alone already has a descent structure, even when $h$ is nonsmooth.

The lecture proved the descent lemma

$$
h(x^{t+1})\le h(x^t)-\eta \|G_\eta(x^t)\|^2
$$

and more generally

$$
h(x^{t+1})
\le
h(x^*)-\eta \|G_\eta(x^t)\|^2+G_\eta(x^t)^T(x^t-x^*).
$$

These lemmas are not especially complicated once you know the optimality condition for the proximal operator. The whole proof comes from one key fact:

if
$$
u=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(v),
$$
then
$$
\frac{1}{\eta}(v-u)\in \partial h(u).
$$

That fact says the proximal step does not just produce a new point. It also gives you a valid subgradient of $h$ at the new point.

That is the reason the descent lemma works so cleanly.

#### Step 1: Rewrite the Update Using the Gradient Mapping

When $g=0$, the update is

$$
x^{t+1}=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x^t).
$$

The gradient mapping becomes

$$
G_\eta(x^t)
=
\frac{1}{\eta}(x^t-x^{t+1}).
$$

So the actual step is

$$
x^t-x^{t+1}=\eta G_\eta(x^t).
$$

This identity is used repeatedly below.

#### Step 2: Use Proximal Optimality

Take the general proximal optimality statement

$$
u=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(v)
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
\frac{1}{\eta}(v-u)\in \partial h(u).
$$

Now substitute

- original version: $u=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(v)$
- new version: $x^{t+1}=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x^t)$
- substitution being made: $v \mapsto x^t$ and $u \mapsto x^{t+1}$

This gives

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}(x^t-x^{t+1})\in \partial h(x^{t+1}).
$$

Now use the identity from Step 1:

- original version:
$$
\frac{1}{\eta}(x^t-x^{t+1})\in \partial h(x^{t+1})
$$
- new version:
$$
G_\eta(x^t)\in \partial h(x^{t+1})
$$
- substitution being made:
$$
\frac{1}{\eta}(x^t-x^{t+1}) = G_\eta(x^t)
$$

So the gradient mapping is actually a subgradient of $h$ at the new point $x^{t+1}$.

That is the core structural fact in this proof.

#### Step 3: Recall the Subgradient Inequality

If $s\in \partial h(y)$, then for every $z$,

$$
h(z)\ge h(y)+s^T(z-y).
$$

Rearranging,

$$
h(y)\le h(z)-s^T(z-y).
$$

We will use this with

$$
y=x^{t+1},
\qquad
s=G_\eta(x^t),
$$

because Step 2 showed that

$$
G_\eta(x^t)\in \partial h(x^{t+1}).
$$

So for any comparison point $z$,

$$
h(x^{t+1})\le h(z)-G_\eta(x^t)^T(z-x^{t+1}).
$$

This one line is the starting point for both descent lemmas.

#### Step 4: Prove the First Descent Lemma

Choose the comparison point

$$
z=x^t.
$$

Then the general inequality from Step 3 becomes

- original version:
$$
h(x^{t+1})\le h(z)-G_\eta(x^t)^T(z-x^{t+1})
$$
- new version:
$$
h(x^{t+1})\le h(x^t)-G_\eta(x^t)^T(x^t-x^{t+1})
$$
- substitution being made:
$$
z \mapsto x^t
$$

Now substitute the step identity from Step 1:

- original version:
$$
h(x^{t+1})\le h(x^t)-G_\eta(x^t)^T(x^t-x^{t+1})
$$
- new version:
$$
h(x^{t+1})\le h(x^t)-G_\eta(x^t)^T(\eta G_\eta(x^t))
$$
- substitution being made:
$$
x^t-x^{t+1} = \eta G_\eta(x^t)
$$

Now simplify the inner product:

$$
G_\eta(x^t)^T(\eta G_\eta(x^t))
=
\eta \|G_\eta(x^t)\|^2.
$$

So we obtain

$$
h(x^{t+1})\le h(x^t)-\eta \|G_\eta(x^t)\|^2.
$$

That is the first descent lemma.

The meaning is simple: each proximal step reduces the function value by at least a multiple of the squared gradient-mapping norm.

#### Step 5: Prove the More General Inequality

Now return to the same starting point from Step 3, but choose a general comparison point $z=x^*$:

- original version:
$$
h(x^{t+1})\le h(z)-G_\eta(x^t)^T(z-x^{t+1})
$$
- new version:
$$
h(x^{t+1})\le h(x^*)-G_\eta(x^t)^T(x^*-x^{t+1})
$$
- substitution being made:
$$
z \mapsto x^*
$$

The term $x^*-x^{t+1}$ is not yet in the form we want. Split it by adding and subtracting $x^t$:

- original version:
$$
x^*-x^{t+1}
$$
- new version:
$$
(x^*-x^t)+(x^t-x^{t+1})
$$
- substitution being made:
$$
x^*-x^{t+1}=(x^*-x^t)+(x^t-x^{t+1})
$$

Insert this into the inequality:

$$
h(x^{t+1})
\le
h(x^*)
-G_\eta(x^t)^T\big((x^*-x^t)+(x^t-x^{t+1})\big).
$$

Distribute the inner product:

$$
h(x^{t+1})
\le
h(x^*)
-G_\eta(x^t)^T(x^*-x^t)
-G_\eta(x^t)^T(x^t-x^{t+1}).
$$

Now rewrite the two terms separately.

For the first one,

$$
-G_\eta(x^t)^T(x^*-x^t)
=
G_\eta(x^t)^T(x^t-x^*).
$$

For the second one, use Step 1 again:

- original version:
$$
-G_\eta(x^t)^T(x^t-x^{t+1})
$$
- new version:
$$
-G_\eta(x^t)^T(\eta G_\eta(x^t))
$$
- substitution being made:
$$
x^t-x^{t+1}=\eta G_\eta(x^t)
$$

and then

$$
-G_\eta(x^t)^T(\eta G_\eta(x^t))
=
-\eta \|G_\eta(x^t)\|^2.
$$

Putting everything together,

$$
h(x^{t+1})
\le
h(x^*)
-\eta \|G_\eta(x^t)\|^2
+
G_\eta(x^t)^T(x^t-x^*).
$$

That is the second inequality.

#### Step 6: Why This Matters

This example is one of the best intuition-building pieces in the proximal-gradient unit:

- arbitrary subgradients do not usually give such a clean descent statement
- the proximal step does, because it comes from minimizing a regularized objective

So the proximal map is doing more than taking a "legal" nonsmooth step. It is producing a point whose associated subgradient automatically carries descent information.

That is why proximal methods are much better behaved than plain subgradient descent when the problem has the right composite structure.

## 2.4 Important Proximal Examples

### 2.4.1 Indicator Functions

If $h=\mathbb{I}_C$, then prox is projection.

### 2.4.2 $\ell_1$ Regularization and Soft Thresholding

For

$$
h(z)=\lambda \|z\|_1,
$$

the prox is the soft-thresholding operator applied coordinatewise:

$$
[S_\tau(x)]_i
=
\begin{cases}
x_i-\tau & x_i>\tau \\
0 & -\tau\le x_i\le \tau \\
x_i+\tau & x_i<-\tau.
\end{cases}
$$

Equivalently,

$$
S_\tau(x)_i=\operatorname{sign}(x_i)\max(|x_i|-\tau,0).
$$

For the Lasso objective

$$
f(x)=\frac12\|Ax-b\|^2+\lambda \|x\|_1,
$$

we have

$$
g(x)=\frac12\|Ax-b\|^2,
\qquad
\nabla g(x)=A^T(Ax-b),
$$

and the prox step becomes

$$
x^{t+1}
=
S_{\eta_t\lambda}
\left(
x^t-\eta_t A^T(Ax^t-b)
\right).
$$

This is ISTA.

### 2.4.3 Why ISTA Matters

ISTA is the canonical example for the whole unit:

- take a gradient step on the data-fit term
- take a soft-thresholding step on the sparsity term

So the method is not abstract. It directly recovers one of the most standard sparse-learning algorithms.

### 2.4.4 Connection to the Earlier Soft-Thresholding Lecture

Before the proximal-gradient lecture, the course already derived soft-thresholding from optimality conditions.

For the problem

$$
\min_x \frac12\|y-x\|^2+\lambda \|x\|_1,
$$

the February 17 optimality-conditions lecture wrote

$$
0\in -(y-x^*)+\lambda \partial \|x^*\|_1
$$

and then solved this coordinatewise to obtain the soft-thresholding formula.

That earlier lecture matters because it shows that the prox of $\lambda\|x\|_1$ is not a mysterious black box. It is exactly the optimizer of a quadratic-plus-$\ell_1$ objective, and it can be derived from subgradient optimality.

So when proximal gradient later writes

$$
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta \lambda \|\cdot\|_1}(v)=S_{\eta\lambda}(v),
$$

it is reusing a result that the course had already motivated from first-order optimality.

### 2.4.5 Matrix Completion and Nuclear-Norm Prox

The February 24 examples lecture extended the same pattern to matrices.

In matrix completion, one often uses

$$
f(X)=g(X)+\lambda \|X\|_*,
$$

where $\|X\|_*$ is the nuclear norm, the sum of singular values.

This is the matrix analogue of $\ell_1$ regularization:

- $\ell_1$ promotes sparse vectors
- nuclear norm promotes low-rank matrices

If

$$
Y=U\Sigma V^T
$$

is an SVD, then the prox of the nuclear norm is singular-value soft-thresholding:

$$
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta \lambda \|\cdot\|_*}(Y)
=
U\Sigma_{\eta\lambda}V^T,
$$

where $\Sigma_{\eta\lambda}$ is obtained by soft-thresholding the singular values in $\Sigma$.

This example is useful even if the exam only tests it conceptually:

- it shows prox methods are not only coordinatewise tricks
- it shows the same framework works for structured matrix regularization
- it reinforces that the complexity of the method lives in the prox for $h$

## 2.5 Proximal-Operator Properties

### 2.5.1 Optimality Condition of the Prox Step

If

$$
u=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(v),
$$

then first-order optimality of the prox subproblem gives

$$
0\in \frac{1}{\eta}(u-v)+\partial h(u),
$$

which is equivalent to

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}(v-u)\in \partial h(u).
$$

This is one of the most important identities in the entire section.

It is worth seeing exactly where it comes from.

By definition,

$$
u=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(v)
$$

means that $u$ minimizes

$$
\psi(z)=\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-v\|^2+h(z).
$$

Since $\psi$ is convex, first-order optimality says

$$
0\in \partial \psi(u).
$$

Now take the subdifferential term by term:

- the quadratic part is differentiable, with gradient
$$
\frac{1}{\eta}(u-v)
$$
- the nonsmooth part contributes
$$
\partial h(u)
$$

So

$$
0\in \frac{1}{\eta}(u-v)+\partial h(u).
$$

Rearrange:

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}(v-u)\in \partial h(u).
$$

That is the prox optimality condition.

You use it constantly:

- to identify the subgradient of $h$ at the prox point
- to prove contraction
- to prove the fixed-point theorem
- to prove the descent lemma

### 2.5.2 Contraction / Nonexpansiveness

For convex $h$, the prox operator is a contraction in the sense

$$
\|\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x)-\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(y)\|^2
\le
\langle x-y,\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x)-\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(y)\rangle,
$$

and therefore

$$
\|\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x)-\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(y)\|
\le
\|x-y\|.
$$

The first inequality is actually the more important one. It is stronger than ordinary nonexpansiveness and is often called **firm nonexpansiveness**.

The proof is not long, but it uses several ideas in sequence. So it helps to slow it down.

#### Step 1: Name the Two Prox Points

Let

$$
u=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x),
\qquad
v=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(y).
$$

We want to compare $u$ and $v$ in terms of $x$ and $y$.

So the target inequality becomes

$$
\|u-v\|^2\le \langle x-y,u-v\rangle.
$$

#### Step 2: Write the Prox Optimality Condition at Both Points

From proximal optimality,

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}(x-u)\in \partial h(u),
\qquad
\frac{1}{\eta}(y-v)\in \partial h(v).
$$

This means that the vectors

$$
s_u:=\frac{1}{\eta}(x-u),
\qquad
s_v:=\frac{1}{\eta}(y-v)
$$

are valid subgradients of $h$ at $u$ and $v$, respectively.

#### Step 3: Use Monotonicity of the Subdifferential

For a convex function, the subdifferential is monotone. That means:

if $s_u\in \partial h(u)$ and $s_v\in \partial h(v)$, then

$$
\langle s_u-s_v,u-v\rangle \ge 0.
$$

Now substitute the specific subgradients from Step 2.

- original version:
$$
\langle s_u-s_v,u-v\rangle \ge 0
$$
- new version:
$$
\left\langle \frac{1}{\eta}(x-u)-\frac{1}{\eta}(y-v),\,u-v\right\rangle \ge 0
$$
- substitution being made:
$$
s_u=\frac{1}{\eta}(x-u),
\qquad
s_v=\frac{1}{\eta}(y-v)
$$

Factor out $\frac{1}{\eta}$:

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}\left\langle (x-u)-(y-v),\,u-v\right\rangle \ge 0.
$$

Since $\eta>0$, multiplying by $\eta$ does not change the sign:

$$
\left\langle (x-u)-(y-v),\,u-v\right\rangle \ge 0.
$$

#### Step 4: Regroup the Difference

Now simplify the first vector:

- original version:
$$
(x-u)-(y-v)
$$
- new version:
$$
(x-y)-(u-v)
$$
- substitution being made:
$$
(x-u)-(y-v)=x-u-y+v=(x-y)-(u-v)
$$

So the inequality becomes

$$
\langle (x-y)-(u-v),\,u-v\rangle \ge 0.
$$

#### Step 5: Expand the Inner Product

Distribute the inner product:

$$
\langle x-y,u-v\rangle - \langle u-v,u-v\rangle \ge 0.
$$

Now use

$$
\langle u-v,u-v\rangle = \|u-v\|^2.
$$

So we get

$$
\langle x-y,u-v\rangle - \|u-v\|^2 \ge 0.
$$

Rearrange:

$$
\|u-v\|^2 \le \langle x-y,u-v\rangle.
$$

That is exactly the firm nonexpansiveness inequality.

#### Step 6: Derive Ordinary Nonexpansiveness

Now apply Cauchy-Schwarz to the right-hand side:

$$
\langle x-y,u-v\rangle
\le
\|x-y\|\,\|u-v\|.
$$

Combining this with the previous inequality gives

$$
\|u-v\|^2
\le
\|x-y\|\,\|u-v\|.
$$

Now there are two cases:

- if $u=v$, then the inequality $\|u-v\|\le \|x-y\|$ is automatic
- if $u\ne v$, divide both sides by $\|u-v\|$

So in either case,

$$
\|u-v\|\le \|x-y\|.
$$

That is the usual nonexpansiveness statement.

#### Step 7: Why This Is Stronger Than It Looks

It is easy to read this as just a technical bound, but it is structurally important:

- the prox operator does not amplify perturbations in the input
- it behaves like projection onto a convex set
- the stronger inequality with $\|u-v\|^2$ on the left is what makes many later proofs work cleanly

So the real takeaway is not just "prox is stable." It is that convexity gives the proximal map a very rigid geometric structure.

## 2.6 Fixed Points, Optimality, and Why $G_\eta(x)=0$ Matters

The lecture proved the theorem

$$
G_\eta(x^*)=0
\iff
0\in \nabla g(x^*)+\partial h(x^*).
$$

Since

$$
0\in \nabla g(x^*)+\partial h(x^*)
$$

is exactly the first-order optimality condition for the convex composite objective, this means:

$$
G_\eta(x^*)=0
\iff
x^* \text{ is optimal}.
$$

This is the proximal analogue of the fact that $\nabla f(x^*)=0$ characterizes optimality in smooth unconstrained convex optimization.

The proof is worth understanding.

Before the proof, keep the picture straight:

1. a point is optimal for the composite problem if it satisfies
$$
0\in \nabla g(x^*)+\partial h(x^*)
$$
2. a point is a fixed point of the prox update if
$$
x^*=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x^*-\eta \nabla g(x^*))
$$
3. the gradient mapping is zero exactly when the point is a fixed point:
$$
G_\eta(x^*)=0
\iff
x^*=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x^*-\eta \nabla g(x^*))
$$

So the theorem is really saying that all three of these viewpoints are equivalent.

That equivalence is the main conceptual reason the gradient mapping is important.

If $G_\eta(x)$ were just notation for the step, it would not be very interesting. But the theorem says much more:

- zero gradient mapping
- fixed point of the prox update
- first-order optimality of the composite objective

are all the same statement in different language.

### 2.6.1 Direction 1: $G_\eta(x^*)=0 \Rightarrow 0\in \nabla g(x^*)+\partial h(x^*)$

Start from the definition

$$
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x-\eta \nabla g(x))=x-\eta G_\eta(x).
$$

This identity is just a rearrangement of the definition of $G_\eta(x)$. We are writing the prox output explicitly.

Let

$$
u=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x-\eta \nabla g(x)).
$$

Then prox optimality gives

$$
\frac{1}{\eta}\left((x-\eta \nabla g(x))-u\right)\in \partial h(u).
$$

Now substitute

$$
u=x-\eta G_\eta(x).
$$

This is the key substitution. We are replacing the abstract prox point $u$ by the explicit expression coming from the gradient mapping.

Then

$$
G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\in \partial h(x-\eta G_\eta(x)).
$$

Now the magic happens: if the gradient mapping is zero, then the argument of the subdifferential becomes just $x$, and the left-hand side loses the $G_\eta(x)$ term.

That is why this theorem works. The gradient mapping is defined so that when it vanishes, the prox point collapses back to the original point.

If $G_\eta(x^*)=0$, this becomes

$$
0-\nabla g(x^*)\in \partial h(x^*),
$$

which is exactly

$$
0\in \nabla g(x^*)+\partial h(x^*).
$$

### 2.6.2 Direction 2: $0\in \nabla g(x^*)+\partial h(x^*) \Rightarrow G_\eta(x^*)=0$

If

$$
0\in \nabla g(x^*)+\partial h(x^*),
$$

then

$$
-\nabla g(x^*)\in \partial h(x^*).
$$

Multiply by $\eta$:

$$
-\eta \nabla g(x^*)\in \eta \partial h(x^*).
$$

So

$$
(x^*-\eta \nabla g(x^*))-x^*\in \eta \partial h(x^*).
$$

This is written to match the prox optimality pattern

$$
(v-u)\in \eta \partial h(u).
$$

Here we are choosing

$$
v=x^*-\eta \nabla g(x^*),
\qquad
u=x^*.
$$

By the prox optimality equivalence, this means

$$
x^*=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(x^*-\eta \nabla g(x^*)).
$$

Therefore the gradient mapping is zero:

$$
G_\eta(x^*)=0.
$$

## 2.7 Main Descent Lemma for Proximal Gradient

This is the central theorem of the section.

Assume:

- $g$ is convex and $\beta$-smooth
- $h$ is convex
- $\eta\le 1/\beta$

Then for any $x$ and any comparison point $z$,

$$
f(x-\eta G_\eta(x))
\le
f(z)+G_\eta(x)^T(x-z)-\frac{\eta}{2}\|G_\eta(x)\|^2.
$$

Two especially important specializations are:

1. set $z=x$:
$$
f(x-\eta G_\eta(x))
\le
f(x)-\frac{\eta}{2}\|G_\eta(x)\|^2
$$
This is the direct descent statement.

2. set $z=x^*$:
$$
f(x-\eta G_\eta(x))
\le
f(x^*)+G_\eta(x)^T(x-x^*)-\frac{\eta}{2}\|G_\eta(x)\|^2
$$
This is the form used in convergence proofs.

### 2.7.1 Proof Structure You Should Memorize

This proof was emphasized in lecture and then reused in HW3.

The pattern is:

1. apply smoothness to $g$ at the prox-updated point
2. apply convexity of $g$ to compare $g(x)$ and $g(z)$
3. use convexity of $h$ at the prox point
4. use the prox-optimality identity
$$
G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\in \partial h(x-\eta G_\eta(x))
$$
5. add the $g$ and $h$ inequalities
6. use $\eta\beta\le 1$ to simplify the quadratic term

You do not need to memorize every line, but you do need to know what comes from smoothness, what comes from convexity, and what comes from prox optimality.

If you get lost in this proof, the safest way to organize it is:

- put all the $g$ terms in one bucket
- put all the $h$ terms in one bucket
- only combine them at the very end

Most confusion in proximal-gradient proofs comes from mixing those two buckets too early.

In plain terms:

- use one inequality to control the smooth part
- use a different inequality to control the nonsmooth part
- only after each part is under control do you put them back together

### 2.7.2 Clean Walkthrough of the Main Steps

Let

$$
y=x-\eta G_\eta(x).
$$

Then $y$ is the next iterate.

It is helpful to stop and name this point, because otherwise the proof gets unreadable. Every time you see $x-\eta G_\eta(x)$, you should think "that is the prox-updated point."

From smoothness of $g$,

$$
g(y)\le g(x)+\nabla g(x)^T(y-x)+\frac{\beta}{2}\|y-x\|^2.
$$

This is just the usual smoothness inequality for the smooth part. We are temporarily pretending $h$ does not exist.

Since $y-x=-\eta G_\eta(x)$,

$$
g(y)\le g(x)-\eta \nabla g(x)^T G_\eta(x)+\frac{\beta \eta^2}{2}\|G_\eta(x)\|^2.
$$

Now use convexity of $g$:

$$
g(x)\le g(z)+\nabla g(x)^T(x-z).
$$

This is the first-order convexity inequality applied at the point $x$ and compared against the arbitrary point $z$.

The role of this line is very specific: the previous smoothness bound still contains the term $g(x)$, but eventually we want everything written relative to the comparison point $z$.

So we are going to replace the $g(x)$ in

$$
g(y)\le g(x)-\eta \nabla g(x)^T G_\eta(x)+\frac{\beta \eta^2}{2}\|G_\eta(x)\|^2
$$

by an upper bound for $g(x)$.

Write the previous line as

- original version:
$$
g(y)\le g(x)-\eta \nabla g(x)^T G_\eta(x)+\frac{\beta \eta^2}{2}\|G_\eta(x)\|^2
$$
- new ingredient:
$$
g(x)\le g(z)+\nabla g(x)^T(x-z)
$$
- substitution being made:
$$
g(x)\mapsto g(z)+\nabla g(x)^T(x-z)
$$

Why is this allowed? Because if a quantity is bounded above by something else, then anywhere that quantity appears on the right-hand side of an inequality, we can replace it by that upper bound and the inequality still remains true.

In symbols, if

$$
A\le B+C
$$

and also

$$
B\le D,
$$

then automatically

$$
A\le D+C.
$$

That is exactly the move being used here, with

$$
A=g(y),
\qquad
B=g(x),
\qquad
C=-\eta \nabla g(x)^T G_\eta(x)+\frac{\beta \eta^2}{2}\|G_\eta(x)\|^2,
$$

and

$$
D=g(z)+\nabla g(x)^T(x-z).
$$

So

$$
g(y)\le g(z)+\nabla g(x)^T(x-z)-\eta \nabla g(x)^T G_\eta(x)+\frac{\beta \eta^2}{2}\|G_\eta(x)\|^2.
$$

For the nonsmooth part, convexity of $h$ at the prox point $y$ gives

$$
h(y)\le h(z)-u^T(z-y)
$$

for any $u\in \partial h(y)$.

This is where many people get tripped up: the subgradient for $h$ is taken at the prox point $y$, not at the original point $x$.

By prox optimality, we may choose

$$
u=G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x).
$$

This is not a random guess. It comes from the identity proved earlier:

$$
G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x)\in \partial h(x-\eta G_\eta(x))
=
\partial h(y).
$$

So

$$
h(y)\le h(z)-(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x))^T(z-x+\eta G_\eta(x)).
$$

Expand that:

$$
h(y)\le h(z)-(G_\eta(x)-\nabla g(x))^T(z-x)-\eta \|G_\eta(x)\|^2+\eta \nabla g(x)^T G_\eta(x).
$$

Now add the bounds for $g(y)$ and $h(y)$.

The $\eta \nabla g(x)^T G_\eta(x)$ terms cancel, leaving

$$
f(y)\le f(z)+G_\eta(x)^T(x-z)+\left(\frac{\beta \eta^2}{2}-\eta\right)\|G_\eta(x)\|^2.
$$

This cancellation is the main reason the proof works cleanly. The smooth part creates one $\nabla g(x)^T G_\eta(x)$ term and the prox-optimality handling of $h$ creates the opposite one.

So if you are ever checking your algebra and the proof is not simplifying, one of the first things to inspect is whether you wrote the $h$ inequality using the correct prox-point subgradient. That is what makes the cancellation possible.

If $\eta\le 1/\beta$, then

$$
\frac{\beta \eta^2}{2}-\eta \le -\frac{\eta}{2},
$$

so

$$
f(y)\le f(z)+G_\eta(x)^T(x-z)-\frac{\eta}{2}\|G_\eta(x)\|^2.
$$

That is the main descent lemma.

## 2.8 Convergence Rate in the Convex Case

For $\beta$-smooth convex $g$ and convex $h$, proximal GD with step size

$$
\eta=\frac{1}{\beta}
$$

achieves

$$
f(x^k)-f(x^*)
\le
\frac{\beta}{2k}\|x^0-x^*\|^2.
$$

So the rate is

$$
O(1/k).
$$

This is one of the headline results of the lecture. The full objective is nonsmooth, but because the nonsmoothness is structured, we still recover the smooth-convex GD rate.

### 2.8.1 Proof Template

The proof mirrors gradient descent.

Start from the update

$$
x^{t+1}=x^t-\eta G_\eta(x^t).
$$

At this point the proof is basically copying the smooth GD proof, except every ordinary gradient is replaced by the gradient mapping.

Expand the distance to the optimum:

$$
\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2
=
\|x^t-x^*\|^2
-2\eta (x^t-x^*)^T G_\eta(x^t)
+\eta^2 \|G_\eta(x^t)\|^2.
$$

Rearrange:

$$
\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2
=
\|x^t-x^*\|^2
+2\eta
\left(
\frac{\eta}{2}\|G_\eta(x^t)\|^2-(x^t-x^*)^T G_\eta(x^t)
\right).
$$

Now use the descent lemma with $z=x^*$:

$$
f(x^{t+1})
\le
f(x^*)+G_\eta(x^t)^T(x^t-x^*)-\frac{\eta}{2}\|G_\eta(x^t)\|^2.
$$

This implies

$$
\frac{\eta}{2}\|G_\eta(x^t)\|^2-G_\eta(x^t)^T(x^t-x^*)
\le
f(x^*)-f(x^{t+1}).
$$

This is the exact place where the descent lemma plugs into the distance recursion. If you lose this line, the rest of the proof feels like magic.

Substitute into the distance expansion:

$$
\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2
\le
\|x^t-x^*\|^2+2\eta(f(x^*)-f(x^{t+1})).
$$

Rearrange:

$$
f(x^{t+1})-f(x^*)
\le
\frac{1}{2\eta}
\left(
\|x^t-x^*\|^2-\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2
\right).
$$

With $\eta=1/\beta$,

$$
f(x^{t+1})-f(x^*)
\le
\frac{\beta}{2}
\left(
\|x^t-x^*\|^2-\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2
\right).
$$

Now sum from $t=0$ to $k-1$. The right-hand side telescopes:

$$
\sum_{t=0}^{k-1}(f(x^{t+1})-f(x^*))
\le
\frac{\beta}{2}
\left(
\|x^0-x^*\|^2-\|x^k-x^*\|^2
\right)
\le
\frac{\beta}{2}\|x^0-x^*\|^2.
$$

Divide by $k$ and use monotonicity of the function values under the descent lemma to conclude

$$
f(x^k)-f(x^*)
\le
\frac{\beta}{2k}\|x^0-x^*\|^2.
$$

So the real proof pattern is:

1. one-step distance recursion
2. use descent lemma to control the hard inner-product term
3. get a telescoping difference of squared distances
4. sum over time
5. divide by $k$

That is basically the same story as smooth gradient descent:

- derive a one-step inequality
- turn it into a telescoping sum
- extract the rate from the telescoping structure

The only new ingredient is that the gradient mapping and the prox optimality condition replace the ordinary gradient.

## 2.9 Strongly Convex Extension

This is where HW3 connects directly to the lecture.

Assume now:

- $g$ is $\beta$-smooth
- $g$ is $\alpha$-strongly convex
- $h$ is convex
- $\eta\le 1/\beta$

Then the strengthened descent lemma is

$$
f(x-\eta G_\eta(x))
\le
f(z)+G_\eta(x)^T(x-z)-\frac{\eta}{2}\|G_\eta(x)\|^2-\frac{\alpha}{2}\|x-z\|^2.
$$

Compared with the ordinary convex case, the new term is

$$
-\frac{\alpha}{2}\|x-z\|^2.
$$

That is exactly the strong-convexity improvement.

### 2.9.1 Where the New Term Comes From

In the ordinary proof, convexity of $g$ gives

$$
g(x)\le g(z)+\nabla g(x)^T(x-z).
$$

In the strongly convex case, you get the sharper inequality

$$
g(x)\le g(z)+\nabla g(x)^T(x-z)-\frac{\alpha}{2}\|x-z\|^2.
$$

That is the only structural change, but it propagates all the way to linear convergence.

### 2.9.2 Linear Convergence Theorem

With $\eta=1/\beta$ and condition number

$$
\kappa=\frac{\beta}{\alpha},
$$

the proximal-gradient iterates satisfy

$$
\|x^k-x^*\|^2
\le
(1-1/\kappa)^k\|x^0-x^*\|^2.
$$

So proximal gradient gets the same linear-type contraction you would expect from optimizing the smooth strongly convex part alone.

This is one of the main conceptual victories of the method:

- the full objective is nonsmooth
- but the structured nonsmoothness does not destroy the strong-convexity rate

### 2.9.3 Proof Idea for the Linear Rate

The HW3 hint is exactly right: combine

- the proximal-GD convergence proof from the convex case
- the strongly-convex GD proof style

Set $z=x^*$ in the strongly convex descent lemma:

$$
f(x^{t+1})
\le
f(x^*)+G_\eta(x^t)^T(x^t-x^*)
-\frac{\eta}{2}\|G_\eta(x^t)\|^2
-\frac{\alpha}{2}\|x^t-x^*\|^2.
$$

Then plug that into the distance expansion

$$
\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2
=
\|x^t-x^*\|^2
-2\eta (x^t-x^*)^T G_\eta(x^t)
+\eta^2\|G_\eta(x^t)\|^2.
$$

Exactly as in the strongly convex GD proof, the function-value term disappears because $f(x^*)\le f(x^{t+1})$, and the extra

$$
-\frac{\alpha}{2}\|x^t-x^*\|^2
$$

creates contraction. With $\eta=1/\beta$, the recursion becomes

$$
\|x^{t+1}-x^*\|^2
\le
\left(1-\frac{\alpha}{\beta}\right)\|x^t-x^*\|^2
=
\left(1-\frac{1}{\kappa}\right)\|x^t-x^*\|^2.
$$

Then iterate this bound over $t$.

## 2.10 What Quiz 3 Suggests You Must Know Precisely

Quiz 3 asked for:

1. the convergence rate of proximal GD
2. the actual steps of the algorithm, including the prox definition

That means you should be able to write, cleanly and from memory:

$$
\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(v)
=
\arg\min_z \frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-v\|^2+h(z)
$$

$$
y_{t+1}=x_t-\eta \nabla g(x_t)
$$

$$
x_{t+1}=\operatorname{prox}_{\eta,h}(y_{t+1})
$$

and the standard convex guarantee

$$
f(x^k)-f(x^*)
\le
\frac{\beta}{2k}\|x^0-x^*\|^2.
$$

One important correction to keep straight:

- the theorem is a function-value guarantee
- not a statement that $\|x^k-x^*\|^2$ is itself shrinking like $O(1/k)$ in the basic convex case

## 2.11 How This Section Connects to Homework 3

HW3 Problem 1 was not asking for a new algorithm. It was testing whether you could:

- define the prox point
- identify the gradient mapping
- separate the smoothness argument for $g$ from the convexity argument for $h$
- use prox optimality at the prox point
- recognize where strong convexity changes the descent lemma

That is why the homework guide kept emphasizing:

- the prox point is $x-\eta G_\eta(x)$
- prox optimality gives a subgradient of $h$ at the prox point
- the smooth and nonsmooth pieces must be handled separately

If you can explain those three sentences clearly, you understand the unit at the level the homework wanted.

## 2.12 Exam-Facing Checklist

You should be able to do the following without hesitation:

- define the proximal operator correctly
- explain why prox generalizes projection
- write the proximal-gradient update in both two-step and one-line forms
- define the gradient mapping
- state why $G_\eta(x)=0$ is the right stationarity condition
- explain why $G_\eta(x)$ reduces to $\nabla g(x)$ when $h=0$
- derive ISTA for the Lasso
- state the main convex descent lemma
- state the convex $O(1/k)$ convergence theorem with its full inequality
- state the strong-convexity extension and the linear rate
- explain what comes from smoothness, what comes from convexity, and what comes from prox optimality

## 2.13 Common Traps

- Treating $h$ as if it were differentiable.
- Forgetting that the subgradient from prox optimality is taken at the prox point, not at the original point.
- Saying the gradient mapping is just the update direction and not a generalized optimality object.
- Forgetting that the basic convex theorem controls function value, not necessarily squared distance.
- Mixing up the roles of the convex theorem and the strongly convex theorem.
- Remembering only "$O(1/k)$" and forgetting the full theorem statement.
- Forgetting the special-case connections:
  - $h=0$ gives GD
  - $h=\mathbb{I}_C$ gives projected GD
  - $h=\lambda \|x\|_1$ gives soft-thresholding / ISTA
