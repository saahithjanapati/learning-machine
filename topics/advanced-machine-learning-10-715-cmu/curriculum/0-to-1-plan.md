## Course Identity

10-715 is the fast, proof-heavy PhD-level introduction to machine learning. The public Fall 2025 course page describes it as a class for students whose primary field is machine learning or whose research will depend on methodological ML. CMU's course comparison page describes 10-715 as the fastest-paced and most mathematical intro ML course, intended to prepare students to read and write research papers in machine learning.

The curriculum below treats 10-715 as a bridge from "I know math and programming" to "I can reason about ML algorithms at research-paper depth."

## Target Outcome

By the end, the learner should be able to:

- explain supervised learning through the formal objects of data, hypothesis class, loss, risk, and empirical risk;
- prove basic algorithmic guarantees, not just apply algorithms;
- derive perceptron, hard/soft SVM, kernel, and representer-theorem results at a whiteboard;
- use concentration and uniform-convergence ideas to explain generalization;
- connect neural-network representation and optimization behavior to older linear/kernel methods;
- explain the basic mathematical structure of bandits, reinforcement learning, graphical models, and causal graphical thinking;
- understand score matching and diffusion models well enough to read the assigned papers with a map.

## Prerequisites

- Linear algebra: subspaces, projections, eigenvalues, SVD, positive semidefinite matrices.
- Probability: conditional probability, expectation, variance, multivariate Gaussians, concentration basics.
- Calculus: gradients, Jacobians, constrained optimization, matrix calculus fluency.
- Optimization: convexity, Lagrangians, KKT conditions, gradient-based methods.
- Programming: Python fluency sufficient for ML experiments and homework implementation.
- Proof habits: comfort with inequalities, induction, contradiction, and translating informal statements into quantified claims.

## Module 7: Homework, Exam, And Research-Reading Loop

Objective: Convert passive lesson reading into proof fluency and exam resilience.

Core sources:

- homework handouts and solutions,
- previous-year midterms and finals,
- available graded copies in the processed source folder.

Cadence:

- After each content module, solve at least two representative homework/exam problems.
- For every missed proof, write a two-part correction: the false move and the reusable proof pattern.
- Use prior exams only after the concept lesson is complete, not as the first exposure.

Exit check:

- Complete one timed mixed set covering linear classifiers, generalization, and one modern topic.
- Write a one-page "research reading memo" for one assigned diffusion or score-matching paper.

## Session Cadence

- Session length: 60-90 minutes.
- Sessions per week: 3-4 for catch-up; 2 for maintenance.
- Practice ratio progression:
  - early: 60% exposition, 40% proof/coding practice;
  - middle: 40% exposition, 60% proof/problem practice;
  - late: 20% review, 80% timed mixed problems and paper reading.

## Assessment Plan

- Quick checks: definitions, algorithm steps, theorem statements, one-line intuitions.
- Medium practice: proof sketches, derivations, short coding experiments.
- Capstone task: solve a mixed exam-style set and write a research memo connecting one late-course paper to the lecture path.
