# Learner Evidence Tracker

## When To Use

Use this skill when the learner asks for:
- tracking questions or doubts over time
- logging mistakes for future adaptive practice
- keeping a searchable record of confusion by topic or concept
- a reusable history of incorrect answers or proof gaps

This skill also applies when a live tutoring session reveals:
- a clear doubt
- an incorrect answer
- a repeated notation confusion
- a proof setup gap
- a concept that should influence future question difficulty

## Core Files

- `learning_system/learner_evidence/EVIDENCE_LOG.jsonl`
- `learning_system/learner_evidence/INDEX.md`
- `learning_system/learner_evidence/by_topic/<topic>.md`

## Delegation Default

When subagent delegation is allowed in the current session, prefer spawning a worker subagent to perform evidence writes.

Default pattern:
- main agent continues the teaching / grading / explanation work
- worker subagent runs the evidence write in the background
- do not block on the worker unless the evidence result is immediately needed for the next user-facing step

Use direct local CLI writes only when:
- delegation is unavailable or disallowed in the current turn
- the write is the only task and there is no responsiveness benefit from delegation
- the next critical-path action depends on the finished evidence artifact right away

## Workflow

1. Identify the evidence event:
- topic
- subtopic
- one or more concept tags
- event type
- current review state

2. Record the timestamp:
- use the exact local timestamp when the event is observed
- if backfilling from an older transcript, mark the timestamp precision honestly

3. Prefer delegating the write to a worker subagent.
- hand off:
  - topic / subtopic
  - concept tags
  - event type
  - review state
  - summary
  - learner signal
  - assistant response summary
  - source path / turn
- the worker should run:
  - `python3 scripts/learning_cli.py log-evidence ...`
- `log-evidence` already refreshes the learner-evidence indexes, so an extra `evidence-index` call is usually unnecessary

4. If delegation is not being used, write the evidence entry locally with the CLI:
- `python3 scripts/learning_cli.py log-evidence ...`

5. Keep entries compact and useful:
- short summary of the issue
- optional learner quote/paraphrase
- optional assistant response summary
- source path and turn when available

6. Use the generated indexes later:
- overall summary in `INDEX.md`
- topic-specific evidence in `by_topic/`

## Event-Type Guidance

Prefer one primary event type:
- `doubt`
- `incorrect-answer`
- `partial-answer`
- `notation-confusion`
- `proof-gap`
- `recall-gap`

## Review-State Guidance

Use:
- `open` when the issue is recognized but not yet addressed
- `addressed` when it has been explained once
- `reinforced` when it has been revisited successfully
- `stable` when it no longer looks like a live weakness

## Guardrails

- Do not create vague entries like “seems shaky on optimization.”
- Prefer concept-level tags like `indicator-function`, `conditional-expectation`, or `newton-root-vs-minimization`.
- Do not overwrite old evidence; append new events so recurrence can be measured.
- Keep timestamps honest. If precision is approximate, mark it as backfilled.
